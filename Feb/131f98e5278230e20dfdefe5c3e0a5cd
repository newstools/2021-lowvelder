Piers Cruickshanks, deputy head: academics at Penryn College, said they are thrilled to celebrate their matric class of 2020. “Facing unprecedented challenges and broken dreams for their final year of school, they have turned the tables on fate and taken their future back. “While we are especially proud of those high achievers who have once again achieved four, five and six distinctions (all of them with less on-campus class time with their teachers than ever before), we are equally proud of each individual – One and All – every one of them has passed! “We admire their courage and determination and wish them well for everything that lies ahead. Having grown mentally and emotionally to face the trying year that was 2020, we know that they are now equipped to take on their tertiary studies, the world of work, and indeed, any challenges their lives ahead may bring.  “We applaud our teachers who have been exemplary in their professionalism, adaptability and selflessness and who have moved heaven and earth for the young men and women that the community, that is Penryn, has produced.” Penryn College IEB NSC results summaryPenryn achieved a 100 per cent pass rate.
