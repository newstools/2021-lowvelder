A fire had broken out on the morning of January 24, quickly filling the air around the area with thick, black smoke. Sonae Arauco’s chief industrial and technology officer, Dionne Harber, said the cause was thought to be equipment failure. “The Nelspruit and White River fire departments responded so quickly, they definitely prevented a lot of damage to the site,” he said. “We had done emergency tests before where we had called the fire departments for drills, but they never showed up. We were actually a little nervous that if we ever had a real fire, nobody would come, but they did. And they arrived speedily.

They showed such a huge commitment to dousing the flames and ensuring the damage to the factory was minimal.” Harber said the staff and management were “so grateful” for the help. He met with senior CMLM municipal officials at the Mbombela council chamber yesterday morning to discuss the donation and the quick response of the fire departments. City of Mbombela mayor, Sibusiso Mathonsi, Mbombela general manager of public safety, Luckie Sihlamgu, and Mbombela acting senior manager of disaster management, Lyncia Mkhabela, all thanked Harber and the factory for the generous donation.
