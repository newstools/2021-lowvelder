The members of community policing forums (CPFs) will now start receiving a monthly stipend. This was announced by the MEC for the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison (DCSSL), Gabisile Tshabalala, on Friday at Mbombela Stadium during the first phase of the handing over of material to CPFs structures.  “We have heard your outcry and we are sure that you are happy to hear this. We want to fully work with you. We want to appreciate the relationship we have with the provincial CPF board chairperson, Kevin Pillay,” explained Tshabalala. DCSSL handed over reflector jackets, caps and torches. Pillay received the material on behalf of the members. The initiative is part of combating crime and mobilising communities to enable them to do so. All members from the 29 police stations in the Ehlanzeni area will receive the material to help them fight crime. This was the first phase of the programme that will see all CPFs at SAPS stations across Mpumalanga receiving equipment.   Tshabalala officiated the handover. Neighbouring regions will receive there material in the coming weeks. “The department hopes that the volunteers who serve in CPFs will continue to be motivated to assist the police in the fight against crime. Those who are doing it for fun must leave,” she said.    ALSO READ: Find your inspiration among the orchids Some of the representatives from various CPFs attended the event.
