The Department of Education (DoE) has not delivered the grade R centre for Klipspringer Primary School, which it promised in 2019. The department did construct new classrooms for other grades and toilets. In May 2019 the school governing body (SGB) and parents shut down the school. At the time, Catherine Mokoena, SGB chairperson, said 781 learners were cramped into classrooms with a 240-pupil capacity. A civil and structural engineer had also issued an inspection report that stated that the slabs in some classrooms had deformed beyond their safety limits. The report stated that the roof was inadequately designed and was exhibiting signs of structural failure. The department then promised to add new classrooms, bathrooms and fix the damaged classes. Just before the 2021 academic year began, the SGB sent out two letters to the department, which this paper has seen. “We sent out the first letter in 2020 and the second one in January. We wanted an update as to what was happening to the grade R development. We were shocked to see that there is no structure,” explained Mokoena.
