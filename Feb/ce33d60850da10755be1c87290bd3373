According to George Mthethwa, the spokesperson for the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), one victim died in an accident in Ermelo when three vehicles collided due to a flooded intersection between Ermelo and Hendrina. At Kanyamazane, a second victim was swept away when his house, situated next to a water stream, was flooded over. The third victim, aged 30, drowned in the Mhlonhloma River at Nyongane outside Hazyview. His body, severely damaged, was later recovered on the banks of the river. Meanwhile, the N4 between KaNyamazane and Matsulu has been cleared following a rockfall that had blocked half the road. The provincial MEC of Cogta, Mandla Msibi, has urged motorists to drive carefully, and to beware dangerous objects that had fallen into the roads in Ehlanzeni. He also expressed concern about communities whose houses are located too close to river banks and water streams. The department is currently making an assessment of the damages to the infrastructure to determine the way forward. More information about rainwater damage will be revealed as it becomes available.
