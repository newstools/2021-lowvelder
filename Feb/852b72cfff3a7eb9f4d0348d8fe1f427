The bridge between Tekwane South and eNtokozweni leading to KaNyamazane has totally collapsed.  The Lowvelder and its sister papers, Lowvelder Express and Mpumalanga News, reported early in the week that a sinkhole had developed on this bridge as a result of the heavy rainfall in the area.  In the space of five days, this sinkhole has led to the bridge totally collapsing, leaving motorists and pedestrians stranded. First to arrive at the scene was the ward councillor, Joseph Mashaba, who quickly alerted the police and authorities at the City of Mbombela Local Municipality. “I am still in shock but relieved that no one was hurt when the bridge collapsed. I am just worried about the people who own houses near the stream that separate these two townships,” said Mashaba. He urged motorists and pedestrians alike to avoid using this road. Earlier this week Tekwane South and eNtokozweni community members took to the streets, calling for the City of Mbombela to repair the sinkhole. During this protest, they predicted that the hole would sink further and the bridge collapse.
