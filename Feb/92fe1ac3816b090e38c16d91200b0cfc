The second episode is an introduction to ecological restoration. As 2021 is the launch of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, they will be chatting to plant ecologist Dr Pat Holmes about some principles behind ecosystem restoration and how we can play an active role in restoring South Africa’s many damaged ecosystems. Examples from the Nama Karoo (by Dr Sue Milton-Dean), the banks of the Breede and Berg rivers (Phil McLean) and the KZN Midlands (Isabel Johnson) will showcase the variety of restoration work already taking place across South Africa.
