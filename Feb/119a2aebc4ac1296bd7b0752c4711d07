“As a school we were well aware that the face of education will have to evolve and adjust with time to offer our scholars the best education.”  The Penryn Prep Online School was conceptualised in 2019 when their team of highly qualified academics started moulding this unique bespoke curriculum. “We are now proud to announce that Penryn Prep Online is now fully operational, utilising the wonderful developments in modern technology, to break down the classroom walls and to travel and explore the world” says Nicole Dos Santos, Penryn Prep Online HOD.  “Our scholars are afforded the opportunity to investigate 21st-century world issues like climate change, deforestation, farming, plastic oceans, sustainability, and the ever-shrinking natural world. Technology allows our scholars to travel the globe or go back in time to compare changes on our planet,” says Dos Santos.  The Online School uses interactive and collaborative technologies together with real-world issues to keep scholars engaged and passionate, and to provide a learning platform of purpose for these young architects, cultivating them to become the scientists, the journalists, the geologists, the historians, the mathematicians and the innovators of tomorrow.
