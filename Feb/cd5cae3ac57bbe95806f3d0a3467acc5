In a statement earlier today, Eskom said the load-shedding is necessary to preserve and replenish the emergency generation reserves and to maximise the capacity available during daytime hours. The statement said the power generation system is still severely constrained due to high generation unit breakdowns during the past two days, as well as the delayed return to service of some units on planned maintenance. “We currently have 4 858MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 375MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays,” said Eskom in the statement. “Eskom expects some of these generation units to return to service from tomorrow, and will continuously assess the situation,” it said.
