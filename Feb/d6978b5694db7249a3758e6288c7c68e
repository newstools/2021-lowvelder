The electricity provider released a statement this morning that the situation had been exacerbated by the forced shutdown of five generating units at the Medupi Power Station in Limpopo, as a result of the inability to get coal into the units due to the heavy rain in the Lephalale area on Thursday night. “The area received 65 millimetres of rain, which added to the constraints caused by the heavy rain due to Eloise over the past two weeks. “Eskom has implemented contingency plans and deployed additional resources to deal with the heavy rainfall in Mpumalanga and Limpopo, and the teams are working hard to return as many of these units to service as soon as possible. “We currently have 4 114MW on planned maintenance, while another 15 739MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned maintenance. “Eskom would like to urge the public to reduce electricity usage in order to help us minimise load-shedding. The system remains vulnerable and unpredictable,” said the statement. ALSO READ: Local tourism industry feels abandoned
