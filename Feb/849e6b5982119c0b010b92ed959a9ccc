Afri Orchids will host an open day that can be enjoyed by both young and old. Jolisa Grobler of Afri Orchids said there are 13 greenhouses in total. “You can safely keep your distance from other orchid lovers. The guests can stroll through and take photographs at their leisure. Our greenhouses will be open to the public on February 13 and 14.”  “For those who need a bit of inspiration, they can spend some time walking through the garden. The tea garden will have food, sweet treats and drinks. Kids are welcome, provided they wear a mask and keep a safe distance from other patrons,” Grobler explained.  On Saturday Afri Orchids will be open from 08:00 to 16:00. On Sunday it is open from 09:00 to 15:00. “The entrance is free and we have lots of parking.” ALSO READ: The way to someone’s heart is through their stomach “We have a dedicated sales area with lots of orchids as well as tillandsias and platyceriums.
