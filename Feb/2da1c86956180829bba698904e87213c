“We are restricted when it comes to organising functions or hosting anything that includes groups of people,” explained CANSA Mpumalanga community mobiliser, Pauline Möller. The CANSA Relay for Life Mpumalanga committee held a coin laying at the i’langa and Riverside malls to raise funds for the project. “We give our thanks and appreciation to the two malls involved that allowed us to do the coin laying,” Möller said. CANSA relies on income generated from its fundraising events and projects in order to sustain the holistic care and support it provides to those affected by cancer. “CANSA Relay for Life celebrated life and hope in the best way we could during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the heart of CANSA Relay for Life is the opportunity to celebrate cancer survivors, to remember those who have left us and create awareness about cancer,” Möller explains. CANSA will continue supporting patients virtually via the online support platforms, toll-free call centre (080-022-6622) and the WhatsApp lines, 072-197-9305 (English and Afrikaans) and 071-867-3530 (isiXhosa, isiZulu, Sesotho and siSwati). A list of staff on call during the nationwide lockdown is also on the CANSA website. No events will take place due to social distancing measures.
