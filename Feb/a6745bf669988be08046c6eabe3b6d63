The intelligence-driven, multi-operational disruptive undertaking was carried out early on Friday morning by Mpumalanga Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation, Pienaar Tactical Response Team, Forensic Science Laboratory Head Office Pretoria, Local Criminal Record Centre Nelspruit and SSG Security. The Mpumalanga Hawks’ spokesperson, Capt Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, said the operation was conducted at a property at Barberton Bo Hill KaMadakwa Section. Sekgotodi said two men, aged 29 and 24, were arrested on the scene. “Information had been received of a suspect who was running two semi laboratories that allegedly were processing gold-bearing materials in Barberton Bo Hill,” she said. Sekgotodi said when police arrived at the property on Friday morning, the two men were found crushing gold-bearing materials. Eight phendukas (a machine for gold refining) and other equipment used for gold-bearing processing materials were seized for further investigation. The two suspects will appear in the Barberton Magistrate’s Court on Monday February 22.
