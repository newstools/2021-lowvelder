Award-winning TV chef, cookbook author and dessert diva, Grace Stevens shares her best recipes to celebrate Valentine’s Day. For her, cooking is more than an activity, it is as an expression of love. It provides us with a way to physically show our care for loved ones by nourishing their bodies and delighting their souls with our culinary creations. Here are Grace’s top takes on how to express your love through food this Valentine’s Day: Few nations can claim to do romance quite like the French, and Grace’s madeleines are the perfect vintage dessert to add a touch of French flair to your Valentine’s Day. And if you are like Grace and have a tradition of hiding a small treat in your children’s lunchbox on Valentine’s Day, they make the perfect stowaways.  If you love soaking up the long summer days, but prefer the cooler embrace of the evening for your picnic, this is the perfect cocktail for you. Using the floral and herbal notes from the garden gives the perfect balance between sweet and strong.  Picnics are a fabulous way to entertain the whole family and with these crustless mini quiches, you will not even have to worry about picking up the crumbs.
