The story takes place in 1983 and is based on Botha and her daughter Lodene’s lives. It came into existence after Abortion Survivors of the Unites States approached Botha and asked whether she would write about her experience with abortion. Her life story, put shortly, is a mother’s struggle to keep her unborn baby alive through multiple forced abortion attempts by her husband, the baby’s father.  On the back cover, the book is described as dealing with “rejection, abortion and death, but graciously also the value of life”.

A life that we can live fully only once we realise the greatness of His grace.

We have everything in our possession; we are equipped with it to live fully to the best of our abilities. “How can we then, as man, deprive a baby of that privilege?” Botha said she is often invited to speak at women’s events, churches and other gatherings where she discusses Lodene and the general subject of abortion respectively. The book has been published in both Afrikaans and English. Some of Botha’s previous works include Afrikaans poetry and also Christian children’s stories.
