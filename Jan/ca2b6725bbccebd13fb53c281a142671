Cancer is not a death sentence. This is the message of hope of this year’s CANSA Relay for Life coin laying at i’langa and Riverside malls. As part of an ongoing fundraising event for CANSA, Mbombela’s two major malls will play host to a coin-laying event on Saturday. “We want people to understand that cancer is not a death sentence,” said Relay for Life co-chairperson, Mariolise le Roux. “There is always a space for hope.” The funds collected at the event will go toward cancer-related research and free screening tests in low-income communities.

It’s the best way to save a life. The problem is that the tests actually cost a lot to conduct, so CANSA is totally dependent on donations.” The coin laying will take place on Saturday from 09:00 to 16:00 on the ground floor of i’langa Mall, and in the Elephant Court of Riverside Mall (between entrances 1 and 2).
