Steiltes residents were awakened by six gunshots fired in rapid succession this morning when a suspect was shot and killed. According to a source close to the investigation, the incident occurred at about 04:00. “The homeowner was asleep in his sitting room when he was startled by the sound of people in his house. According to him, between four and five suspects were in the house after trying to steal his bakkie,” the source said. After apparently having failed to open the bakkie, the suspects proceeded inside to remove his wallet and find the vehicle keys.
