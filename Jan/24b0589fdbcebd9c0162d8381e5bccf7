On Sunday night the storm passed through the transmission lines from Cahora Bassa in Mozambique without any incident. The high-risk sections of the transmission lines were reinforced after similar storms in previous years. However, the risk remains with the possible flooding of rivers and uprooting of trees in the areas surrounding these lines. Operations at the power stations continue as normal, although Eskom teams will continue to monitor the progress of the storm and impact of the heavy rains. Typically, heavy rainfall for four or fewer days does not pose a significant threat to power station operations, but continuous heavy rainfall for more than four days does hamper coal handling at the power stations and the mines supplying them. Power lines in some parts of Mpumalanga, Limpopo and northern KwaZulu-Natal experienced localised outages as a result of trees and poles falling on power line districts.
