“Eskom has assessed the risks and the possible impact on our infrastructure and the provision of electricity,” said the statement. “Several plans are in place in anticipation of the storm, and Eskom is also covering a wider area than what is predicted by the weather specialists to ensure we are not caught off guard.” Eskom said that most of its power stations are in Mpumalanga with two other major power stations in Lephalale.

Eskom said there are some power stations in the Mpumalanga area that have been experiencing ash dam constraints and that continuous heavy rainfall over these power stations could hamper operations and recovery efforts already underway.
