This year will be the beginning of some learners’ school career, some will begin with primary and some preschool. As parents/guardians, it is advisable to teach your kids safety tips since you will not be with them at all times. Here are some safety tips from www.saps.gov.za to consider teaching your children before they head to school. • They must know their full name(s), parents’ names, address and phone number. • Explain the difference between a good secret and a bad one. A good secret is fun to keep, such as a surprise party. A bad one feels bad to keep and makes you feel scared. • Use the buddy system and avoid walking or playing alone outside or in public places. • Home safety: Keep all the doors and windows locked when you are in your house alone. Go to a neighbour and call 10111 if a window is broken or if the door is open when you get home. • Doorbell safety: Answer the door by asking: “Who is it?” Never say you are alone and never open the door when you are alone, unless it is someone your parents told you to expect and let him/her/them in. • Phone safety: Never say you are alone when a stranger calls. You can say, “Mom/Dad cannot come to the phone now. Can I take a message?”
