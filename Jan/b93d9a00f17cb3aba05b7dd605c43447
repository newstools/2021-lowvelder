GRIP is in need of donations of care bags and teddy bears. This organisation helps thousands of survivors of rape and domestic abuse, young and old. They offer counselling and treatment, teach communities about rape, HIV/AIDS and abuse, and offer victims shelter. Dedicated to providing professional care and compassion to survivors of rape, they have run out of care bags.  GRIP’s founder, Barbara Kenyon, said they are trying to raise funds by selling masks and other various items. She said as an organisation they want to continue providing the services to victims and survivors. “We need the public to help us. We used our last supplies this week and we would appreciate any contribution that we can get. “We need the care bags for the victims and the teddy bears for the kids. Some victims need toiletries when they arrive at the hospital and police stations. The packs we put together are handed to them. The teddy bears are used when dealing with children and it plays a vital role in the process.” GRIP relies entirely on donated funds and fundraising initiatives.

The allegations are under investigation, and those implicated have denied any wrongdoing.
