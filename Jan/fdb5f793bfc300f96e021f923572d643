Today TRACN4 said in a statement that according to engineers on site, “the infamous Cyclone Eloise” had caused damage to the N4 that required the Elandskloof section of the road to be closed to traffic on Sunday night. TRACN4 said further investigations found that around 160 millimetres of rain had fallen in the Ngodwana area between Saturday January 23 and Monday January 25 which resulted in a flash flood that uprooted stumps and trees causing damage to the highway infrastructure.

This resulted in road-fill material underneath its surface to be washed away, which caused the road surface to subside,” said Van Niekerk in the statement. “We are relieved that the culvert itself was not damaged as this would have resulted in a longer repair period.” Road users travelling between the Lowveld and Highveld and Gauteng regions must use the N4 Toll Route’s alternative route -Schoemanskloof – while TRAC carries out major repair work in the affected area. “We apologise for the inconvenience and commit ourselves to repair the damages as soon as possible with operations already under way. We want to thank members of the public for their understanding, patience and support during this time.” For information about other parts of the route, road users are urged to contact the TRAC 24-hour Helpdesk on 0800-87-22-64 or visit its website, www.tracn4.co.za, or follow it on Twitter, @TRACN4route, or Facebook, @TRACN4.
