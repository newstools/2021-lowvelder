As a result of the heavy rain the area received in the last 24 hours, dam levels in the Inkomati-Usuthu catchment are increasing. Kwena Dam, which supplies water to users downstream, including the City of Mbombela, had been a serious cause for concern last week as it continued to drop below the 30 per cent mark. Now, according to the Department of Water and Sanitation’s weekly state-of-reservoirs report, Kwena increased from 28 per cent last week to 35,2 per cent. This is expected to further increase as more rain is forecasted and rivers running into the dam are reported to be flooded.
