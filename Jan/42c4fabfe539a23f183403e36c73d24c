White River DA councillor, Rowan Torr, said several transformers had been damaged and had cut power to the water pumps to the town’s reservoirs, thereby leaving White River without water. “The people from the energy department need to come start work on the transformers so the water department can help restore water to the town but the weather has made it impossible for energy to go out,” said Torr. “The energy department cannot go work on anything until the rain has subsided and it is safe for them to work.” Torr said although the lack of water and electricity was frustrating, most residents in town were patient as they understood these “are unusual circumstances”.

It is terrible. Residents are working together to try clear the roads and any other areas damaged by the storm.” Torr urged the public to remain patient as everyone was on high alert and working hard due to the storm.
