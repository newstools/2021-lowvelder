The statement said, although “the province has survived the tropical cyclone Eloise”, it remains on high alert. The MEC of Cogta, Mandla Msibi, said in the statement the department will continue to monitor the weather patterns to respond to potential life-threatening emergency cases. “All our disaster management systems remain on high alert. Our roads are slippery and we urge motorists to drive carefully. Those in the proximity of rivers and dams must monitor the water levels to evacuate in time,” said Msibi. He further cautioned communities not to risk their lives by crossing bridges and walking below power lines. He further warned against the circulation of fake news that may cause panic and anxiety. Councillors, community development workers and the disaster toll-free number have been activated to respond to distressed communities. Although no major incidents have been reported since the heavy rain started, sporadic cases of damaged houses in Mkhuhlu, Bushbuckridge, have been reported to the municipality. The department’s disaster toll-free number is 0800-507-202. ALSO READ: Mbombela one of the hardest hit in Eskom storm damage
