Kruger had been a car guard at The Pub for almost 20 years and was considered to be a part of the restaurant’s family. Homann said the funeral home was looking for her relatives as they cannot cremate her remains without her family’s consent. Homann said a man, who had apparently been in the car with Kruger at the time of the accident, had recently dropped off her ID and a few personal belongings, but said the two had not been in a relationship. Homann added that Kruger has two funeral policies, one with FNB and the other with PEP, but there is no information or records of any family members. He said he had heard that Kruger had a daughter in Pretoria and is looking for her contact details. Should anyone have any information on Kruger’s relatives, call Homann on 082-922-6509.
