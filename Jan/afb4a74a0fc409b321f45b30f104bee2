PCA founder, Dr Andre Hattingh, said they were able to make the four-tonne donation to 100 families in Magalela informal settlement thanks to “the generous food grant given to us by IDC (Industrial Development Corporation)”. “A very happy crowd gathered around, their identity documents in hand and masks on their faces, to collect their 40 kilograms of food for each family, as part of our Covid-19 festive season food drive to ensure no child or parent goes to sleep hungry over the Christmas period,” said Hattingh.

Hattingh added that IDC’s food grant has given many families the chance to eat well for the next few weeks. “We at Pediatric Care Africa thank you very much,” he said.  Hattingh also thanked Steelwings Motorcycle Club Lowveld “Who worked very hard offloading food and ensuring every person received their food parcels”. “We are delivering our last food parcels and bulk food early next week, and then we are done for this year of 2020,” said Hattingh.
