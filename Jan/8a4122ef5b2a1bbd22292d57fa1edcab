Anyone who is diligent with recycling will tell you they get a tremendous kick, knowing they are helping to minimise the rubbish that reaches landfill sites. Garbage disposal – the transport, logistics, staff and cost of a landfill site – cost millions of rands and result in increased garbage disposal rates for ratepayers. In the end this results in high accommodation costs when you go on holiday. When children are involved in recycling, it gives them a tremendous sense of importance, knowing they are helping to minimise their impact on the planet. Sometimes we don’t think to reuse items: Items to recycle: When rinsing an item, do not let the water down the sink, pour the water out of the carton or container into a bucket and pour this grey water on to a plant or grass outside. Do not place polystyrene or styrofoam containers or cups into the blue bags. They cannot be recycled.
