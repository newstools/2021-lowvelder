New Year’s celebrations usually go hand in hand with booze and parties. And while it may all seem like fun and games at the time, it might hit you hard the following day. Here are a few suggestions to help get you through that hangover. Even though some might say drinking Crème Soda for a hangover is a myth, it sure helps. The sugar gives you the energy you need to make it through the day while the bubbles hydrate the cells that have been dried out by alcohol. Make sure you drink it ice cold for an extra boost. A good old greasy breakfast or juicy burger and chips is always a good idea when suffering from a hangover. It is also a great idea to have fatty foods before you start drinking because it slows the rate at which you absorb alcohol. It may seem obvious, yet this is one of the most important hangover cures that people always seem to forget. Since alcohol is a diuretic, it makes you pee more frequently and leads to increased water loss. Thus, drinking water is crucial to replenishing these lost fluids. Tomatoes contain compounds that protect against liver injury. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to liver damage, so tomatoes may counter the effects of alcohol. Bananas are especially rich in potassium and can help refill your body’s stores. This helps to put sodium and potassium back in your body to prevent dehydration.
