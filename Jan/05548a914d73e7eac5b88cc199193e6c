The Penryn Preschool Team was delighted to welcome back the Kingfisher (two years and up) and Nest (three to five years) classes back to campus on Monday. The team had returned to campus the previous week to get all classrooms, playgrounds and facilities ready for the fun. “It was the first time ever attending a school for many of the new preschoolers who joined us. Luckily they had the Penryn family welcoming them with open arms,” said Penryn’s marketing. The screening of parents, staff and scholars is very strict on campus, and the preschoolers are sanitised upon entering classrooms and heading back home.
