“So far, all systems are in place to ensure a smooth marking process which is scheduled from January 4 to 22,” explained MEC Bonakele Majuba. He said the department has increased the number of marking centres to 19. Majuba said this will ensure adherence to social distancing and accommodate the increased number of scripts to be marked. Adequate marking personnel were appointed and trained with the exception of markers who will receive a two-day orientation upon their arrival at the marking centres. “Everyone will be fully screened upon arrival and this is expected to be a daily routine until the last day of marking.

All marking officials are expected to follow Covid-19 precautionary measures by wearing masks, sanitising, regularly washing hands, and practising social distancing. “As we embark on this important task of marking scripts for our learners, it remains prudent that all measures to secure the integrity of the examination are adhered to. Equally, it is of paramount importance to observe the Covid-19 protocol at all times. “I wish everyone the best and guarantee the full support of the department to ensure the safety of every member while upholding the integrity of the examinations,” said Majuba.
