The students who are studying The Island, a play centred around two prisoners on Robben Island, were pleasantly surprised when they encountered John Kani, renowned co-creater of The Island, in the Market Theatre’s foyer. According to Roneque Janse van Rensburg, marketing officer of Penryn, Kani met with the group of students and reminded them how the play is a witness to man’s resilient life force. Along with the visit to the Market Theatre, where the group watched a theatre production, the tour also included a trip to Constitution Hill Prison. “The visit to Constitution Hill was insightful and humbling, to discover what the prisoners had to go through years ago in apartheid South Africa and we realise it is such a relief to live freely now,” Asanda Themba, a student at Penryn, said. Overall the tour was described by Coltilde Peel, head of drama, as thought-provoking and inspiring. “The events of the day was a testimony to man’s indelible spirit,” Peel said.
