The event was presented in association with PBS Chartered Accountants and PSG Wealth, and Lisa Erasmus (the first member of the club and its managing director) explained the how and why. “The main purpose of the Legend Ladies Investment Club is to empower woman through financial coaching to make a difference in one another’s lives.” The theme for Wednesday’s event was “2021: The year of transition”.  Erasmus said Anet Ahern, CEO of PSG Asset Management, intrigued the ladies with such topics as thinking differently about risk, the conservative Warren Buffet approach to investing and the “fast money” Wolf of Wall Street hype.
