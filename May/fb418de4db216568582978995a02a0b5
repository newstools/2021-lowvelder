Khensani – who has been shooting under the coaching of Cornelia Roodt, shooting coach of Rob Ferreira, for the past four years – moved up from 11th to second place in the province two weeks ago. “Due to Covid-19, the learners can’t shoot against other schools,” Roodt said. “Therefore, they shoot at the school and are ranked according to their scorecards that are sent in.” According to Roodt, 12 of Rob’s learners are currently competing in this manner. “All of them are ranked on provincial level between the ages of 14 and 21,” she said. Khensani and her teammates have two competitions left for this term. After school break, they will have two final competitions, the last of which will serve as a qualifying round for the national team. “We compete against the entire province every two weeks,” Khensani said. “Every shot is mentally focused; there is a lot of focus attached to the sport.” ALSO READ: Mr Teen Mpumalanga finalist encourages confidence in men Roodt stated that Khensani, who is left-handed, competes with right-handed guns. “Our school only has right-handed guns; however, this has never hindered her.”
