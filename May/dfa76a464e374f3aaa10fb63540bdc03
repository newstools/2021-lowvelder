Nothing could be done for him, and he was declared dead,” said Russel Meiring, communications officer of ER24. “Five others were in a critical condition, while nine had sustained minor to moderate injuries. “Rescue services had to use specialised equipment to free the entrapped patients from the taxi. Once released, medics treated the patients and provided the critically injured with advanced life support interventions.” Patients were transported by various services to nearby hospitals for urgent care. On arrival at the hospital, however, another critically injured patient succumbed to their injuries and was declared dead. Local authorities were on the scene to investigate the cause of the collision.
