Annemarie Botha (65) and her mentally disabled son, Ruan Brits (36), were brutally murdered in their home on Valley Farm on April 24. The assailants fled, after which they killed two more people, whose names are still not known to Lowvelder. These two victims’ bodies were later discovered by police, who, along with other law enforcement agencies, believe all four murders to be related. The autopsy found that Botha had been stabbed over 30 times. Her defensive wounds also indicated that she had put up a fight against her attackers. One of the other victims, whose body was found near KaNyamazane, had also been stabbed, but with what appears to be a panga. The other was found closer to the farm and is believed to have been beaten to death.

Brits lived in the Wenakker Intellectually Disabled Adult Centre in Lydenburg and only visited the couple over weekends. Jaap Breedt, Faan’s cousin and spokesperson for the family, said that though there were developments in the case no arrests have been made, which police confirmed. Jaap has said that Faan is still struggling with the loss. “I don’t think he’ll ever get over it.”
