A G4S armoured vehicle was travelling on the King Mohlala Road when, according to reports, five or six assailants in balaclavas and bulletproof vests brough it to a halt. The assailants fled the scene in a white Ford Ranger. Capt Lucy Sekgotodi, spokesperson for the Hawks, confirmed the incident. She could not confirm if any money had been stolen. This is a developing story.
