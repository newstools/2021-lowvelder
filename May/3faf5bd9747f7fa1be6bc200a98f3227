On a quest to expand her territory online, Pinky Phosa has become one of the mentors of The Elevation Alliance (TEA). TEA made the announcement that she was one of its mentors last week. It is a newly established NPO pre-launched at the Jenna Clifford Design Studio. Phosa recently established a NPO called the Pinky Phosa Solutions Foundation. She said, “I recently launched my foundation and I accepted the offer to be a mentor because I want to expand my ability to reach out to people. I want to continue serving the community through various online programmes.” This woman wears many hats; she is a social worker by training, an accomplished public representative and a community builder. The South African Council for Business Women Nelspruit recently awarded her an honorary member certificate. Phosa is a former chairperson of the standing committee on appropriations and a former member of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) and PBO Advisory Board. She is a former chairperson of the portfolio committee on higher education and training, a former MEC for economic development, environment and tourism, a former MEC for finance, and a former deputy speaker and Speaker of Mpumalanga.
