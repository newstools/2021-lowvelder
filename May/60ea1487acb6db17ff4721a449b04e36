Routes at this year’s Mopani Barberton XCM exposed riders to various terrain types, from water crossings to single track, from the Greenstone Wildlife Estate to some of the richest gold mines in the world, through Sappi plantations to thousands of macadamia trees, from rocky ascents to fast descents – there was something for every preference. A full report including the results will be published in the next print edition of Lowvelder. > Here are some of the photos taken on the day. Credit: Stefan de Villiers. Copyright: Lowveld Media
