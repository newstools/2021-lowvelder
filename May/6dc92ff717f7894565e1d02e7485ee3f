He hit the cement verge on the right hand side of the road and crashed over a ditch into thick dense bush.” De Villiers said Khumalo is lucky to be alive. A witness came to his aid, helping him out of the vehicle. They made him a cup of coffee and helped to calm him down while the SPCA’s support team made their way to the scene.

The vehicle has since been recovered and towed to a repair service provider. “We are in the interim paying for a rental vehicle as the bakkie Edwell was driving is our only vehicle. “We wish to request the support of the community to assist with funds toward the payment of the rental vehicle and/or any other assistance companies and individuals can offer us.  “We are always desperately fundraising and this unforeseen expense now adds a heavy burden to the expenses that we have to cover.” De Villiers asked that the community please visit the White River SPCA Facebook page or contact De Villiers directly on 083-664-7505 should they wish to assist in any way.
