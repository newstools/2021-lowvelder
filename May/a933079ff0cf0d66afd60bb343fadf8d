The Simple School Solution is a comprehensive software solution that will allow teachers, parents and learners to access and use specific parts of the software for studying, reporting, monitoring and much more. It is extremely user-friendly and will lessen the time teachers spend on admin and increase teaching and education time. The software was developed by Joshna Nagar of APJ Technologies in Mbombela. Deon van Vuuren of the Department of Education, who attended the training workshop at Penreach, holds (his personal opinion) that this solution offers tremendous possibilities both as a standalone as well as with some integration with SA-SAMS currently being used by most schools.  Some of the teachers at Zwelisha Primary have now been introduced to the software and a pilot period will follow. “It drove its purpose home, I can’t wait to practice it with success in class to benefit my learners,” said a teacher, Eunice Lukhele. Another teacher, Dudu Dlamini, said, “This is exactly what we need in the school to transform from paperwork to online teaching, especially during the Covid-19 era and beyond.”
