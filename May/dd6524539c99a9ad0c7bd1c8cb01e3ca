The DA in Mpumalanga recently challenged the ANC on the growing number of cash-in-transit heists in the province. In response, the ANC rejected the opposition’s proposal to assist those transporting cash in order to ensure their safety. “The ANC’s reluctance to intervene raises serious questions,” said Trudie Grové-Morgan, MPL and Mpumalanga DA’s spokesperson for community safety, security and liaison, in a statement. This comes after another CIT heist had occurred last week on the R40 between Mbombela and Barberton, in which two guards were injured and three vehicles hijacked by assailants armed with automatic weapons.

The latest crime statistics are expected to be released tomorrow. “It is worrisome that CIT robberies have become so common in Mpumalanga, that it is starting to become the norm,” said Grové-Morgan. It is as yet unclear on what grounds the Provincial Legislature based their decision.
