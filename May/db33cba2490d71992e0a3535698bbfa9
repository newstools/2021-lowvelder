The sale was initially set for Saturday, but due to the wet and cold weather, the small market set up the next day. While only having a few tables at the car boot sale, bargain hunters were spoiled with some exciting second-hand clothing choices and interesting and cute little trinkets. Even a feline visitor enjoyed the sunshine and cuddles from marketgoers. Thrifty threads were on display as well as the brand Crocodile Sauces and some second-hand books for all the bookworms.

The White River SPCA’s Estelle de Villiers said while the sale was a little smaller than they had hoped, they had quite a number of people looking at and buying items to support the SPCA. “Every cent counts. We are always grateful for the support. Even R100 can make such a difference for the animals,” she said. The next car boot sale will be on June 5. ALSO READ: Accused in Kim Kerswill case sentenced
