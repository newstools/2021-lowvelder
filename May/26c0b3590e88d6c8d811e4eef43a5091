The former minister of state security appeared alongside 11 other accused on a case that dates back to 2011, when Bongo was still head of the Mpumalanga Department of Human Settlements. The Hawks only arrested him last October. Bongo and the other accused allegedly colluded to buy properties for far more than they were worth through the Department of Human Settlements. The parties then allegedly profited off the deals that cost the department more than R123 million. The case has been postponed until next January for trial. The full story will be in this week’s issue of Lowvelder.
