“Not All Heroes Wear Capes” is the running theme of the campaign, and is a fitting reminder of all the brave children fighting life-threatening illnesses, and their doctors, nurses and families, who are all true heroes. “This Slipper Day promises to echo the hearts of all our heroes. This is why it is so important for South Africans to come together and believe in the power of dreams and, more importantly, to contemplate what this could mean for a child sick in hospital, ” Julia Sotirianakos, the CEO of Reach for a Dream, said.  Due to the pandemic the foundation had to adapt to ensure the children and their families know they are still being thought of. “To do the work we do at Reach for a Dream is so special, and it is a daily reminder that more hope and heroes are needed in the world,” Sotirianakos added.
