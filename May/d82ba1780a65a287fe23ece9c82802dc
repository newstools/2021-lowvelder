The one guy had been with the business for three weeks while the other one had only been employed for a week and a half. “Thomson Towing has worked so hard to build up a good reputation. This is not how we do business and what these two men did was unacceptable. I don’t want anything to do with them. “They were both desperate for work and so I took a chance on them and then they do something like this. This is not how we operate. There is no excuse for what they did. I am so disappointed.” Thomson thanked the other towing companies for alerting authorities regarding this incident. This is a developing story.
