Thembelihle Hlatshwayo has received a learnership that she will complete at SUPERSPAR Plaza starting in June. The 18-year-old said she is excited to get work experience and see the world outside school. The school caters to pupils with intellectual disabilities. It partners with various businesses to ensure that once its learners exit the gates, they walk straight into jobs, or at least have tangible experience to put on their CVs. “Pupils only get a grade five special education certificate from our school, which isn’t much. We hope learnerships like this give them an edge above learners from mainstream school,” said Debbie Cresswell, occupational therapist of KaMagugu Inclusive School. The school’s curriculum consists of academic and technical subjects, like needlework, gardening, basic office practice and cooking.

Cresswell said they are struggling to find businesses to get involved. Anton Conradie, manager of SUPERSPAR Plaza, said he hopes that this learnership would not only help Thembelihle, but continue for many more years and inspire other local businesses to get involved. Bella Mogane, also of SPAR, said in trying economic times like these, it is important to get involved in the community. “We are trying to empower the younger generation, especially when you look at youth unemployment.” Thembelihle will work at SUPERSPAR after school on Fridays, where she will see what being in the workforce is like.
