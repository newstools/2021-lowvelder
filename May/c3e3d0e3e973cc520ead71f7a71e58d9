“Our learners can’t really compete against other schools in terms of sports or academics,” Ansie Viljoen, deputy principal of Pro Gratia, said. “This allows us the opportunity to celebrate our learners – to reward hard work.” Learners were tested in Afrikaans and English. “We had 22 participants between the ages of nine and 18,” Viljoen said. According to her, many learners participated with the encouragement of their teachers. “Initially we didn’t have many participators who wanted to sign up; the learners have the tendency to underestimate their abilities,” she said. “They ended up surprising themselves.” Prizes and certificates were awarded to the top achiever in the Olympiad, as well as to the first, second and third places in each class.

We’ve received such positive feedback from the learners themselves, as well as from their parents,” Viljoen said. The school will be hosting a Maths Olympiad later this month.
