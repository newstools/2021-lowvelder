MBOMBELA – The store management preceded the ribbon cutting ceremony by thanking the staff for their hard work and hospitality. “What makes SPAR special is its people. Your hard work and big smiles are what make people come back,” said Robert Venter of SPAR. “We wish you the best of luck!” The staff took this opportunity to sing and dance. “It was so stunning!” said store manager, Anton Conradie. The owner, Shoayb Ismail, cut the ceremonial ribbon. The reopening served as the official unveiling of the store after the renovations that had started last year, had been completed. The store remained open throughout the renovations, which included retiling, a change in the layout and new signage.
