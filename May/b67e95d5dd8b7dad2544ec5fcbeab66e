Along with these individuals, the MTPA has also absorbed three more students who were studying to be pilots. They have obtained their private pilot licences and will be based within the game management unit of the biodiversity conservation programme where they will work with other staff members in operating light aircraft that will be used in the fight against rhino poaching.

We are confident that their permanent appointment in these units will address the issues of transformation and gender equality. “In order to allow the students to get first-hand experience while working with other scientists within the MTPA, the two students with BSc environmental services will be based at the Lydenburg Research Centre,” said Johannes Nobunga, CEO of MTPA. “The two with a national diploma in nature conservation will be based at the Nooitgedacht Dam Nature Reserve and one at the MTPA’s head office in Mataffin. “With the current shortage of pilots and scientists within the MTPA, we are excited that these young students will close the existing gaps and further enhance their skills within the sector. “The MTPA’s mandate is to ensure that a high level of scientifically based conservation and biodiversity management support is provided,” added Nobunga.
