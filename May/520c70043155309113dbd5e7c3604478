“Our theme for this term is transport,” Jenny Simons, marketing assistant of Uplands, said. “A different mode of transport is covered every week; most of our work during the week was based on cycling in some way.” According to Simons, aspects regarding cycling, such as upkeep, rules and safety were also discussed. Simons stated that the learners creatively came up with their own rules with regards to safety when cycling. “The learners were very excited to participate and show their bikes to the teachers and their friends,” Simons said.
