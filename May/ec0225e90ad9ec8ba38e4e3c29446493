Penryn Prep celebrates Outdoor Classroom Day annually as part of the global movement to make time outdoors part of every child’s day. “Our teachers prepared special lessons and took our pupils outdoors to play and learn,” Roneque Janse van Rensburg, marketing officer of Penryn, said. According to Janse van Rensburg, Penreach also took part in this celebration, however, it took the initiative out to the community. “Penreach celebrated reading camp volunteers and our change agents for the innovative ways in which they have made learning possible outside of the traditional four walls,” Ronald Chanetsa, Penreach programme manager, said. Chanetsa stated that activities included reading, storytelling, dancing, singing as well as toy-making using recycled materials. According to him, the schools visited by the Penreach Asifundze change agents on Friday included Chakaza, Sindzawonye and Phumalanga primaries. ALSO READ: New educational centre unveiled
