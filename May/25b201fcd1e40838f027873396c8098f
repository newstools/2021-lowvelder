“To have been chosen as a finalist is an incredible confidence booster,” Siyabonga said. “It allowed me a platform to reach into my community.” Siyabonga started the HIM initiative in the hopes of giving back to the community. “The initiative is to empower young men who may have struggles,” he said. “At this point we are gathering essentials and toiletries to hand out to them later on.”  According to Siyabonga, these essentials will be handed out to boys in need in and around his community. “We have identified a few schools in need of these essentials,” he said. “I will share my own story, hoping to inspire these boys, when we hand the necessities over.” The crowning of Mr Teen Mpumalanga will take place in eMalahleni on June 5. “I hope to encourage confidence in others through this journey and through my new platform,” Siyabonga said.
