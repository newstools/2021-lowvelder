Unions marched to the Nelspruit High Court to plead with it to be empathetic to the interest of the communities and families of the workers of the Lily Mine. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) had a demonstration outside the court on Tuesday.   Thabo Mokoena, Mpumalanga Cosatu’s provincial secretary, said the matter is in court, and they marched so they could be able to display how many people have been affected by the closure of the mine. “We want the people inside the court building to look outside the window and be able to see just how people are affected by the decision they have to make. We are here to raise our voice and to bring attention to the court, that they should be considerate to the plight of these workers,” he explained.
