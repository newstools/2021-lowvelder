SPCA Barberton mostly deals with domestic animals like cats and dogs, but also addresses matters concerning farm and wild animals. The facility has two cars, which enables it to attend to matters on more remote farms or assist animals as far as Komatipoort and Badplaas, both towns not having their own SPCA. One of its employees, Richman Sibande, is currently in the process of becoming an inspector, an intricate and lengthy process. He recently completed his inspectorate’s exam and is now busy with his various projects needed to qualify as a fully-fledged inspector.

The biggest issue facing the facility is funding. It is always in need of food for the animals. Donations can be left at the facility. Alternatively, it also accepts cash donations. SPCA Barberton will be hosting its AGM on July 14 at 17:30 at the Coffeteria in Crown Street. Anyone interested in joining the committee or who just wants to find out more about the organisation is welcome to join.
