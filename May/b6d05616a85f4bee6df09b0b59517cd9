The 44 learners who participated had the opportunity to learn more about wildlife through conservation lessons. “Our theme for the term is owls, so everything was interlinked,” Megan Carlisle, grade two intern, said. The day’s programme kicked off with a demonstration of tracking and how it is used against poachers. This was followed by a briefing on a project, Rhinos Without Borders, that explores the ways in which rhinos are transported as well as the necessity to do so. The day ended with a picnic by the dam. “The learners were able to spot birds and butterflies,” Carlisle said. According to her, the day encouraged the learners’ appreciation for nature and wildlife. “The learners loved the day and spoke about it non-stop afterwards,” she said. “They loved sharing their stories about the bush and learning more about wildlife.” ALSO READ: Pedalling is part of learning at Uplands
