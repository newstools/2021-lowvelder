Gryvenstein was on his way to Hazyview for a joint special operation between Bossies Community Justice and Hi-Tech, when his assistant, Callem Herbst, and he heard gunshots in the Masoyi area. The two decided to investigate, but as they got closer to the gunshot noises, they decided to wait for the rest of their convoy. As Gryvenstein got out of his vehicle, he found he had pieces of glass in his hair. That was when he realised they were being shot at by assailants in a red Ford Focus. The bullets went through the vehicle. “The bullet that would have hit me is the only one that didn’t go through the door,” he said. Gryvenstein and Herbst managed to get in the damaged bakkie and drive away. However, the assailants started chasing after them. “We got to the rest of our team, at which stage the men sped away.” It was found that the assailants had allegedly just come from murdering another man, whose body was discovered later.

This led to an operation on Tuesday night between Bossies and the SAPS flying squad. They managed to find the assailants, after which a car chase ensued. The assailants crashed their vehicle into a house, but managed to escape. Bossies Community Justice and the SAPS were able to recover three stolen vehicles, a Toyota Corolla, a VW Polo and the Ford Focus used in the attack on Gryvenstein and Herbst. An R5 assault rifle, which is used by the police, was also discovered in one of the retrieved vehicles. A case of attempted murder has been opened with the SAPS. No arrests have yet been made.
