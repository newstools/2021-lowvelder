Guests were treated to a delicious meal and serenaded by the talented Havana Band before James Aling, executive director of Spaces, Places and Partnerships, took to the stage to showcase the new corporate identity and future plans for the precinct.  The future plans include the following:  “We are excited to embark on this journey with our local community to create a unique visitor experience as we endeavour to grow economic value, and further develop Riverside as a destination that excites, because the future isn’t a place we are going to, it’s a place we are going to create at Riverside,” said Aling.
