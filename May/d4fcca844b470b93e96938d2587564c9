It came to light that the college had been established, maintained and operated without having been registered by the Department of Education. The operation of this so-called college is in violation of the South African Schools’ Act (SASA) (No. 84 of 1996) as amended, which clearly states: “No person shall establish and maintain an independent school unless it is registered by the Head of Department.” It further states that any person who contravenes this is guilty of an offence and upon conviction shall be liable to a fine or imprisonment for a period of up to three months. The department advised the parents of all affected children to apply for admission in nearby schools, and that they would be assisted accordingly. The department will continue the drive to close illegal independent schools throughout the week. As some of the schools operating illegally are unknown to the department, members of the community are requested to alert it or the police should they suspect an institution is operating illegally. The acting provincial commissioner of the SAPS in Mpumalanga, Maj Gen Thulani Phahla, indicated that people should stop their illegal activities of operating bogus schools. “It is not only wrong to do so, but also a waste of time for learners. It is something that must be stopped with all the might of the law.” ALSO READ: Senior SANParks official on special leave after sexual assault charges “The operation of illegal schools is very disruptive, as it affects not only the children and their parents, but ultimately affects the smooth running of the teaching and learning programme within circuits and districts. It is on that note that we advise parents to check the legality of any institution before they enlist or register their children,” MEC Bonakele Majuba said.
