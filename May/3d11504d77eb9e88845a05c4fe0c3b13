Last August marked the handover of the construction site at Penryn, on which the centre was born. STEAM is an educational approach to learning through the use of science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics as access points for guiding student inquiry, dialogue and critical thinking. It is estimated that approximately 6 000 learners will be exposed to intensive educational activities and more than 40 000 people will be visiting the centre annually. “The STEAM Makerspace is the first phase of learning activity hosted at the centre,” Andile Ncontsa, Penreach CEO, said. “The phase aims to bring 21st-century learning to the hands and minds of Mpumalanga’s children.” The Makerspace offers various workstations where learners can build and experiment with art, crafts and technology projects. “It will serve as an idea lab and create space for all ages to explore their creativity and cultivate their imagination. “It will give educators, children and parents access to state-of-the-art tools and materials for crafts, robotics, textile design, digital photography and 3D printing.”
