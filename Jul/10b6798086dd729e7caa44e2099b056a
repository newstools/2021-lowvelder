For the first time in Lowveld history, all security companies operating within the area have banded together in an effort to combat fake news, potential violence from looters, and to restore calm to the community. Security companies formed a joint operation command (JOC) unit today. It will be headed by Nelspruit CPF chairperson John Meintjes, Bossies Community Justice general manager Albert Gryvenstein and Hi-Tech operational manager Callum mac Pherson. Every company has received a two-way radio to communicate important information between personnel in different sections of Mbombela and then relay the information back to the JOC unit which will then send it on to Lowvelder. Members o f the unit will gather at Valley Hyper at 15:30 to show they are standing their ground and standing together to protect the community.

It urges the public to stop forwarding any messages pertaining to potential protests, looting and violence in a bid to stop fake news and unnecessary panic. The team has said all information regarding possible protests and rioting will be communicated through Lowvelder as well as the Bossie Community Justice Facebook page. The unit is on high alert and will issue updates and statements accordingly. It has also asked that if residents see any looters or acts of violence, they must call the police or security companies’ control rooms. They must not call security managers and guards’ direct numbers as their phones are already being flooded with multiple texts and phone calls.
