The City of Mbombela has released a statement stating it is operating with limited staff due to a number of Covid cases. The statement said there would be minimal services rendered to customers, as some departments are not at full capacity due to a rise in Covid cases and adjusted level 4 restrictions. “We encourage our clients to continue accessing services online where possible, to limit face-to-face contact, and we further appeal for patience when experiencing delays at some exercise points due to the reduced number of staff members,” said City of Mbombela in its statement. “Also continue to utilise the call centre on 013 759 9301/2/3/5-8, or customercare@mbombela.gov.za, for further assistance.” Mbombela has apologised for any inconvenience caused.
