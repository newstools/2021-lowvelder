During their most recent charity drive, they distributed clothing to more than 50 community members in KaBokweni.  They received an enormous amount of donations, ranging from clothing, shoes, handbags and even household items. The Srinis expressed their gratitude. “We want to say thank you to every family that donated items to this worthy cause. You create so much faith in humanity by giving things without second thought, without expectations of anything in return or any form of recognition.”   The Srinis were amazed by the joy and happiness these donations brought to the community during tough times in the Covid-19 pandemic.  An anonymous community member thanked the Srinis. “They (the community) were very happy with the donations, as they are some of the neediest people. We appreciate this effort, and will welcome you back anytime.” ALSO READ: Warriors on Wheels changes the lives of five families If you would like to take part in these charity drives or would like to donate clothing, toys or food, contact Mahesh Srini on 082 703 2767.
