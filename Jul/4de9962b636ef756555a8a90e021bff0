Four fires raged around several areas in the Lowveld last night. The Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association’s (Lefpa) manager, André Scheepers, once more warned Lowvelders to take care with their fire-making habits. Yesterday’s fires could be seen behind Mediclinic Nelspruit, in Kaapsehoop, on the Long Tom Pass and near Brondal.

The danger is, however, expected to persist until at least Sunday.  “The risk is still very high, so people should especially avoid open fires. “We are currently still fighting two fires in the Lowveld, one of which is in the Barberton Valley. The other has been raging in the Long Tom Pass since yesterday.”
