The upper reaches of the Crocodile River flows through Verlorenkloof, below the escarpment and above Kwena Dam. Eric Johnson of Verlorenkloof Estate said this is the result of a wild trout project that started when 10 wild trout were caught by a group of expert anglers in the river in 2018 and entrusted to neighbouring Lunsklip Fisheries for breeding. Lunsklip Fisheries raised and took care of the brood stock, stripped and fertilised the eggs and bred a batch of fingerlings in the winter of 2020. Johnson first saw a decline in trout numbers after 2015, as the effect of the drought, low water flows and high ambient temperatures became evident. “We were so surprised when the river recovered in 2017 and found that the surviving trout had produced a brood of wild fingerlings in the previous winter season.  The optimal water temperature for trout is 15 degrees Celsius. Verlorenkloof measured water temperatures of up to 25 degrees Celsius in extreme conditions. As temperature rises and dissolved oxygen decreases, fish begin to experience stress. A population of trout that have been selected to be more resistant to temperature stress will be more sustainable in a warming climate. “Since the release of 300 fingerlings, the river’s fishing has recovered wonderfully. The new fish have adapted well to the natural wild environment and have rejuvenated the wild trout that remained in the river. We are getting regular reports from anglers of prolific fishing, with healthy vigorous trout caught with both nymphs and dry flies,” said Johnson. (All photo’s supplied)
