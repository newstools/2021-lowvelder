Lionel Eva, general manager of the large-scale farm, believes the chemicals, used to spray citrus plants, were stolen for the purpose of selling to other farmers. On his way to work Eva noticed boxes lying by the N4 that borders the farm, at first thinking they had fallen off one of the passing trucks.

He found this strange as they only start this process in August. The farm employees immediately went to the chemical store where they found the locks had been cut. Since the building contains dangerous chemicals, access is limited; there are also no cameras. Very specific, highly valued chemicals, all used on citrus, had been stolen. “I think it happened earlier this morning as the boxes they left behind weren’t wet from the dew yet,” said Eva. Ngodwana Police Station confirmed that a case had been opened and was being investigated.
