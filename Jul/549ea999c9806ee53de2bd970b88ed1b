Ngwenya, a staunch supporter of both former President Jacob Zuma and currently suspended ANC secretary, Ace Magashule, was served with his suspension letter on Saturday. His suspension has been looming for weeks following the recent incident of violence that broke out in Nkomazi during the party’s branch meeting, where a number of members were reportedly assaulted and hospitalised. Ngwenya travelled to Nkandla, KwaZulu- Natal to offer support for Zuma last Sunday. Confirming Ngwenya’s suspension was party spokesperson, Sasekani Manzini, who said Ngwenya was suspended for a number of acts which appeared to be in conflict with the constitution, values, principles and traditions of the ANC. “The ANC took a decision to temporarily suspend the membership of Ngwenya after it considered the nature and seriousness of the alleged misconduct or contravention, the impact of the alleged contravention on the proper functioning of the organisation, and the likelihood of further acts of similar misconduct if his membership is not temporarily suspended,” said Manzini.
