With several sewage pools now formed in Ronnie Bester Park, residents say they are fed up with the stench and potential health and environmental hazards. White River DA councillor, Rowan Torr, said he has reported the sewage issues in the park several times but it seemed the municipality could not rectify the problem.  He said the sewage leaks had been continuing on and off for the past six years. “I don’t know why it is taking so long to fix,” said Torr. “Mbombela has four plumber teams stationed in White River and we really have to beg them to come out. Repairs and maintenance are just not being prioritised in this town,” he said. The Power of 8 000 committee member responsible for the park, Lisa Gordon-Davis, said the group had worked hard to turn the park into a place the community could enjoy, but the sewage leaks were a health hazard.

City of Mbombela spokesperson, Joseph Ngala, said the blocked sewer line in the park was opened, but the issue is ongoing due to roots penetrating the outfall line. “The department will in due time source a jetting machine to cut off the roots that grow inside the concrete pipes where they join. In the interim the blockages will be cleared as and when they occur,” he said. ALSO READ: MEC celebrates municipal audit outcomes
