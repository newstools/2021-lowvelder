Protesters had barricaded the Lihawu/Pienaar Road with burning tyres and rocks.  Some of the protesters told the media they wanted Jacob Zuma released, but it has since transpired they had actually been protesting for service delivery.  “I can safely confirm the protest had nothing to do with the former president, Jacob Zuma, but service delivery,” confirmed the provincial police spokesperson, Brig Leonard Hlathi. The road has been cleared and the police are on high alert, patrolling the area. 19:30 Roads leading to Pienaar, Emoyeni and Hlau Hlau are currently barricaded with burning tyres and rocks. Commuters using public transport have been left stranded and protesters on the road are threatening motorists. Road users have no option but to find alternative routes to their destinations.  Our journalist, Mbekezeli Mbuli, is on the scene and will bring you updates as the story develops. Motorists are advised to avoid the Pienaar to KaBokweni road.
