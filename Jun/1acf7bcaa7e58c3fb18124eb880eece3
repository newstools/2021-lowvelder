Preparations for the 2021 Filing Season are in full swing! This means that, in the coming weeks, you will start receiving important tax certificates you require to complete your Income Tax Return (ITR12). The following are important tips that will assist you to be ready to submit your IITR12. Some documents to watch out for in your inbox: Tip 1 – Keep your supporting documents safe and handy for when you may need them to submit your Income Tax Return. Now that you know what supporting documents to expect for this year’s Filing Season, take note of the following dates and filing activities: Tip 2 – You do not need to submit an income tax return if all the below applies to you: However, you have to submit a return if you worked for more than one employer, retired or resigned from employment, if your circumstances have changed in a substantial way or you have other income not reflected on an IT3 a or b, which could be from any other business income, including letting out property. Tip 3 – If you need a tax number, go to www.sarsefiling.co.za in order to register, click on the register tab at the bottom right corner, and follow the steps.  You will automatically be registered for personal income tax and receive a tax reference number. If you are filing on the go, download the Sars MobiApp from Google Play for Android devices, Huawei App gallery for Huawei devices, and App Store for Apple devices and register for eFiling. Tip 4 – Before submitting your return, confirm with your human resources division that they have submitted their PAYE reconciliation and relevant certificates to Sars. If they have not submitted, you can still submit your return but it will not be pre-populated with your IRP5 and may take a bit longer for Sars to finalise. To avoid delays, first, check with your employer.
