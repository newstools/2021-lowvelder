A 49-year-old woman will appear in the KaNyamazane Magistrate’s Court today in relation to a murder that took place in 2018. Meanwhile, the provincial police have launched a manhunt for about 10 other suspects linked to the crime. Sipho Nkosi (34) was kidnapped from his Pienaar home in October 2018 by a group of assailants, who robbed the house before forcing him into a white Nissan and fleeing the scene. The entire ordeal happened in front of Nkosi’s family.
