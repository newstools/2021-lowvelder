Sizwe Mduduzi Mahlalela (38) was arrested on June 17 by the Mpumalanga Serious Organised Crime Investigation team and Nelspruit Crime Intelligence on charges of hijacking. The two units led an intelligence-driven operation to track down the suspects who had shot at a G4S armoured vehicle and an accompanying bakkie on May 6. The suspects attempted to blow open the armoured vehicle with explosives.

They then allegedly hijacked a VW Polo which was later found between White River and KaBokweni. The police have linked Mahlalela to both recovered vehicles. Further investigation by the Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation team established that the suspect had been out on parole on charges of murder and house robbery when the CIT heist had occurred. The case against Mahlalela was postponed to June 28 and he remains in custody.
