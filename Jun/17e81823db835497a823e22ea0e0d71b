The provincial Democratic Alliance Women’s Network has called for three police officers who had allegedly solicited a R25 000 bribe from a rape suspect, to be suspended. Sgt Bonisile Daphney Mjali (45), Sgt Xolani Howard Nxumalo (37) and Const Thulisile Patricia Mkhatshwa (35) are members of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences investigating unit (FCS). They were arrested by the Hawks in KaBokweni on Monday and appeared in the KaBokweni Magistrate’s Court. The DA said in a statement that sexual assault against women in Mpumalanga is rife. “The severity of crimes against women and children is at a peak and cannot be ignored, while the very same police officers the community relies on for safety are the ones who protect the culprits.” ALSO READ: SAPS report of findings in White River Police Station saga postponed Many rape victims do not report the crime due to stigma and distrust of the police, according to Africa Check. The DA said the FCS should provide support and protection to victims of sexual assault. “Citizens cannot continue to fear reporting cases of rape because of the corruption within the SAPS,” the statement read. The officers are all out on bail and will appear in the Nelspruit Commercial Crime Court on July 6.
