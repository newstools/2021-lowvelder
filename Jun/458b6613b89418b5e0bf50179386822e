The executive mayor of Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, Friddah Nkadimeng paid a surprise visit to the roll-out site and commended the senior citizens for braving the chilly weather to be vaccinated. The vaccination roll-out continued on Wednesday at the Lydenburg Civic Centre. Councillors and medical personnel were also able to lend moral support to the gogos and mkhulus willing to receive the vaccination. The elderly came out in their numbers. Yvonne Hartman (62) was the first to receive the jab. “I am very happy to get protection against the virus,” she said. The Department of Health (DoH) has advised patients coming for the vaccine to eat something before and after receiving the shot, to help prevent or reduce any side effects. Those who did not register to be vaccinated are being registered at the vaccination site. For more information on the registration process, visit www.vaccine.enroll.health.gov.za. Vaccination is voluntary and the DoH will announce when the under-60 age group is eligible. After the registration on the website or at the department, the patients will receive an SMS with the scheduled time, date and place. .
