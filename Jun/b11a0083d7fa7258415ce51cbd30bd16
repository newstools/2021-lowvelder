“Imperfections” by Liezel Lüneburg and “In memory of Loekie, and all the others” by Nathani Lüneburg will be showcased till June 20. “We are only allowed 20 people in the gallery; guests were allowed in and out throughout the opening of the exhibitions,” Dana MacFarlane, director of the White River Gallery, said. According to McFarlane, Liezel employed succulents as a medium in “Imperfections”. This exhibition showcases the divergent colours and the variance in the texture of this medium. “Add to that their resilience, drought resistance and a beautiful will to survive even the worst circumstance. They not only grow in the drier parts of the world, but even in the humid Lowveld climate,” Liezel said. McFarlane stated that Nathani’s exhibition focuses on the role dogs play in our lives. “Nathani shared how, during the isolation that accompanied lockdown, her dogs saved her life,” McFarlane said. “She refers to them as her diaphragm – they allow her to breathe.” Nathani’s exhibition includes an installation with chewed shoes. “Shoes frequently offer comfort to our dogs as they smell distinctly of their owner,” Nathani said. All profits made on the selling of these shoes will be donated to Pretoria Dog Rescue. A walkabout of both exhibitions will be held on June 19 before they are closed the next day.
