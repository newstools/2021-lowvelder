“What an amazing opportunity for our children to be exposed to such richness of variety, not only to be enjoyed in their growing up, but also to prepare them for the world of adulthood,” said Andra Phillips, a proud Penryn parent and teacher of the Bridge Builder Project. From this deep cultural diversity the Bridge Builder Project was born. It was in recognition of the fact that children can benefit from a greater understanding of being part of a diverse community. Phillips, in collaboration with a small group of fellow Penryn parents and teachers, developed a nine-week curriculum that was taught to the senior prep in the second term of 2021 as their life skills lesson.The pupils could choose to take the project further, by also doing voluntary assignments at home after each lesson. The intention was to give them an opportunity to really reflect on the lesson, share those reflections in an assignment and implement some of what was learned. On completion of all eight assignments, the children would be awarded a Bridge Builder T-shirt.“We acknowledge with gratitude the sponsors of the T-shirts, Laduma Hardware and Duise Designs. About half of the senior prep children completed all eight assignments,” said Phillips. Phillips was asked by one of the children at the start of the term, “Why are we doing this in life skills lesson? Why aren’t we doing ‘proper’ life skills?” Her response was that it was her firm belief that this is the key life skill, to learn how to build bridges with others across differences. This first leg of the Bridge Builder Project has created space for growth and Phillips will be continuing the project in the college starting next term with grade eight and nine pupils. ALSO READ: Start them young and watch them go! She concluded by saying, “What an adventure for all of us to learn to find that common ground with one another. Let’s encourage our children to continue to do just that.”
