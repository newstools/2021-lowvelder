They say lightning never strikes twice. This, however, does not apply to Xolani Sibande, affectionately known as “Toolany Rock”. This much-loved artist, usually seen playing his music outside Steiltes SPAR, lost his guitar to robbers for the second time. According to him, he was targeted by robbers last Tuesday. He said they appeared to have followed his bus home from Mbombela to Clau-Clau in KaBokweni. Sibande was heartbroken when he shared his story. This artist said he was trying to make a living, yet other people keep robbing him of this opportunity. “On Tuesday night I got into the last bus home at about 22:30. I believe there was a car following our bus. Everyone who got off the bus was robbed by the people who got out of that car. It was two armed guys; they pointed a gun at me and demanded my beloved guitar and everything I had with me. They were driving a white Honda Creta and they just drove off with our things.” Sibande said what broke his heart was that this guitar was a gift he had received from the lead guitarist and vocalist of Soul Taxi. “I got the gift on December 31 and was so happy to start the year on a good note. This was after I was robbed of my previous guitar,” he explained. ALSO READ: Local business women to meet at Tindlovu at the Gardens Sibande cannot afford to purchase another guitar.
