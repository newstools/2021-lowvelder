The unique brand name originates from the combination of two Portuguese words – bem and bom – both meaning good or nice. When combined they translate into the word “awesome”. Situated at The Grove in Riverside, it is a place where you can meet friends, relax and enjoy exquisitely expressed coffees, scrumptious pastries, savouries and bread – all freshly made on-site. And if you feel like something more substantial, the traditional Portuguese meals on offer are just what you need. The Nelspruit Bem Bom has 24 staff and bakers work through the night to ensure that you buy products that are as fresh as can be. “The reception that we have received so far from Lowvelders has been overwhelmingly positive. We love to serve them and offer something different from the ordinary while relaxing with friends and family,” said Hugo Morgado, one of the owners.
