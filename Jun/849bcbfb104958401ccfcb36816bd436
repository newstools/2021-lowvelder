WHITE RIVER –  Zazi De Chef is one of the youth who was hoping to make ends meet after being employed at the restaurant. “I started working for the restaurant two months ago. In the first month we were paid half of our salaries and we were told we would be paid in full the following month. But now the owners are nowhere to be found. The last time the owner and his wife said they were in the Cape. They promised to pay us our salaries immediately. They even sent photos of bank notes to say they had the cash, but to this day we have not been paid,” said Zazi.
