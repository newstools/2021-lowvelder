An invitation is hereby made in terms of section 49 (1) (a) (ii) read with section 78 (6) of the act that any owner of property or other person who so desires should lodge an objection with the municipal manager in respect of any matter reflected in, or omitted from, the valuation roll within the above mentioned period. Attention is specifically drawn to the fact that an objection must be in relation to a specific individual property and not against the valuation roll as such. Should you wish to lodge an objection, the forms can be obtained on our municipal website or any of the following addresses: Barberton Civic Centre; Nelspruit Civic Centre; White River Civic Centre; Hazyview Municipal Services Centre, KaNyamazane Municipal Services Centre, Matsulu Municipal Services Centre, KaBokweni Municipal Services Centre or downloaded from the website: www.mbombela.gov.za. The completed forms must be returned to the above-mentioned municipal offices or posted.  NB: The municipality will take no responsibility for late objection forms posted unless if a registered mail facility has been used, therefore the use of registered mail or courier services is advised. All envelopes should be clearly marked “OBJECTION FORM”. Objections can also be submitted to GV2018.valuations@mbombela.gov.za. Property owners (for only affected properties by the supplementary valuations process) that have not received mailed notices by June 30, 2021 are requested to visit the municipal offices. Enquiries: Pamela Mokoena on 013 759 9220 or Silindile Zwane on 013 759 9273.
