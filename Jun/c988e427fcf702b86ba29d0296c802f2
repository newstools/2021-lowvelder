What at first glance may appear to be a waterfall by the High Court is in fact a burst pipe. The burst pipe has left this section of the N4 that runs parallel to the High Court ankle-deep in water. The pipe provides water to it and the surrounding buildings. Motorists are advised to take caution when driving past here. Silulumanzi is on the scene and hopes to fix the pipe by close of business today.  ALSO READ: Silulumanzi searches for cause of leak at Mostert Street circle
