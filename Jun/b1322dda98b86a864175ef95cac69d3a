Whether your father is a chef in the kitchen or the neighbourhood braai master, there are several items for the home that any father would be grateful to receive on Father’s Day. If your dad has claimed the position of family braai master, perhaps you and your siblings could all contribute towards upgrading his braai area. This could be in the form of purchasing a new grill or maybe even hiring a builder to construct a built-in braai spot for your dad. You could also upgrade his equipment with a motorised grill brush. For smaller gifts, consider a personalised apron or even a customised BBQ branding iron so he can put a unique and personal mark on all his grills.

If he is sentimental, get creative and reach out to a graphic designer to design a custom illustration of your dad’s favourite family picture for him to hang in his study. You can also get a custom mousepad designed with a family photo printed on it. For the fathers who prefer comfy nights in, gift him with a popcorn machine and a mini projector to guarantee a smooth impromptu movie night. For gadget-loving dads, gift him with a new smart TV, a Google Chromecast or smart dimmable lights that he can control through an app. If you want a more personalised gift, get a digital photo frame preloaded with all his favourite pictures.

If your dad is more concerned about his diet, you could also get him a healthy snack subscription box.
