In Youth Month 2021, the Avbob Poetry Mini Competition invites young poets aged 18 and under for the second time to send them two poems in English that are out of the ordinary, whatever that means to you, centred on the theme of Covid-19. The judges want to read about your experience of the pandemic. This might include your wonders and wanderings, your warrior words or earth worries. We want original poetry in stanzas that sparkle, in verses that show us a new view of the times we’re living through. The judges want lines that live on in our minds long after they have finished reading. They want your words, especially those that are out of this world, out of the blue, out of the corner of your eye, out of the frying pan and into the fire. Grab a paper. Find a pen. Fill every line till your poem is done. Let your thoughts erupt on the page or your handy device. Work your imaginative magic. Show us what you have come through during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Youth Month mini competition opens on June 4 and closes on June 23, and is open to any South African citizen 18 years and younger on the closing date. Entrants must have their parent’s permission to enter. Poets may enter up to two poems in English reflecting on their experiences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Entries will only be accepted by email to social@avbobpoetry.co.za. READ MORE: Uplands announces 2022 open scholarship awards The first-placed poem wins R1 000, second wins R700 and third wins R300.
