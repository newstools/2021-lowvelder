Lowveld Walkers held a memorial walk for one of their members.
The Tebogo Memorial Walk was held on Saturday. The participants walked from Matsulu crossing to Matsulu C. The theme of the event was black and white. Tebogo Sithole recently passed away and as a way to honour him they celebrated his life by doing a walk in his name. Joseph Mashaba, the founder of Lowveld Walkers, said Sithole was one of the most active members.
“His sudden death has hurt most of us deeply. He was a member that was part of the organising team.
He was actively involved in all the events. I still have not come to terms with the fact that he is no more. We were so close that I had planned when I finally retire, he will take over from me. He was a dedicated young man that had so much potential,” he said.
