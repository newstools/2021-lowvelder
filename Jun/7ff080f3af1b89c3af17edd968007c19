De Lange and Coetzee were newly employed at Thompson Towing; both had been tow drivers for the company for less than a month when the incident occurred. Thomson Towing’s owner, Tommie Thomson, told Lowvelder last week he was “shocked and disappointed” when he heard about the alleged actions of De Lange and Coetzee.

This is not how we do business,” Thomson said. “They were both desperate for work and so I took a chance on them, and then they do something like this. This is not how we operate. There is no excuse for what they did. I am so disappointed.” ALSO READ: More dark deals on high-mast lights?
