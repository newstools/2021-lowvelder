Local dietician and musician, Reon van Aardt, has temporarily become Skoenlapper Street’s fixer of potholes. He said the pothole had already started forming when he first moved into his Skoenlapper home in December last year.

It is quite a busy road.” Van Aardt said he reported the pothole to the municipality but did not receive any feedback. “So I decided to fill the pothole, plus another smaller pothole next to it, but because I am quite artistic I wanted to be a bit more creative with filling it. “We first filled it at around 22:00 on June 4. We had to fill it late at night because that was the time the road was the most quiet.

Some of the marbles have fallen out but I think it has lasted quite well all in all,” said the dietitian with a smile. He said he would fill it again and redecorate with the marbles when it started to wear out more.
