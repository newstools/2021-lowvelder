“A competitive field of aspiring candidates from 25 primary schools in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Mozambique and eSwatini wrote the scholarship examinations,” Themba Kgopane, marketing director of Uplands, said. “Exceptional results were achieved, which contributed to Uplands making eight open scholarship awards.” Kate Taylor of De La Salle Holy Cross College Junior School received the academic open scholarship award. Sport open scholarships were awarded to Tristan Rijkenberg of Usutu Forest School and Alexis Jones, Dylan Purdon and Ella Mills of Uplands Preparatory School. Isabella Vieira of Riverview Preparatory School received the cultural open scholarship award. All-rounder open scholarship recipients were Kate Howe-Dreyer and Emma Roberts, both of Uplands Preparatory School. “We would like to congratulate the scholarship recipients on their outstanding accomplishments in a tightly contested event,” Kgopane said.
