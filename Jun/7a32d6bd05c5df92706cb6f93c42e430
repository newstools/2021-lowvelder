He was joined by the deputy minister in The Presidency, Thembi Siweya, and local mayors of the SDM.
The event was held at Tubatse Chrome Club. Mathabatha engaged and interacted with stakeholders on the roll-out of the model.
“Khawuleza”, which means “hurry up” in isiXhosa, is the name for a new district coordination model which seeks to “improve the coherence and effect of government service delivery and development”.
He told the attendees that Khawuleza will address monitoring and evaluation. He said some programmes and initiatives that had been rolled out were “not in sync with government’s overarching strategy and were implemented on a piecemeal and silo basis”.
“Monitoring and evaluation have been inconsistent and at times vague, resulting in us having no clear line of sight of what is needed, where it is needed, how it will be done and how much it is costing,” added the premier.  Siweya highlighted that the DDM has been approved by government structures, including cabinet, to integrate service delivery that will be more practical, achievable, implementable, measurable and clearly aligned to the key priorities of the government.
She said Khawuleza was initially launched by President Cyril Ramaphosa in 2019.
“It aims to dismantle the silo approach of implementing government programmes. This is through what is dubbed ‘one district, one plan, one budget, one approach’.”
