In anticipation of World Blood Donor Day on June 14, the SANBS asked everyone to go out to their local donor centres. “This year, World Blood Donor Day finds us recovering from a unique set of circumstances that brought the world to its knees,” said the organisation in a statement, referring to the global health and economic crisis brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. The SANBS called on government and national health authorities to support the development of necessary resources to help boost the collection of blood.
