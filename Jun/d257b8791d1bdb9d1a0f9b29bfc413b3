The City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM) has issued two new tenders for the installation of high mast lights for the eastern and southern region, despite already awarding four high mast light tenders for a period of three years in early 2020. The contractors were appointed in March and May last year and the successful bidders were Machawana Trading Enterprises, Sibusiswe Electrical and Zwide Business Enterprises.

An attorney at Kruger and Partners, Johan du Preez, said it was concerning that two new tenders had been put out when four were awarded last year and would be in place until 2023. “This raises questions about the original tender process and what is going on currently with the installation of high mast lights,” said Du Preez. “This matter needs to be investigated.” Questions to CMLM and National Treasury regarding the two new tenders, which seem to overlap with the tenders currently in place, were not answered by the time of going to press.
