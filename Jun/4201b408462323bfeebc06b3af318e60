Eskom has announced load-shedding has been moved to stage 4 until 22:00 tonight (Wednesday). The power utility said that it is due to additional breakdowns of a unit at Medupi and two units at Duvha power stations. “It is in order to ration the remaining emergency generation reserves, which have been depleted. “ Schedule for today (Wednesday)Delta – Block 10 15:00 to 17:30West Acres – Block 1415:00 to 17:00Matsafeni and Nelsriver – Block 114:00 to 15:30. Rocky Drift and White River – Block 317:00 to 19:30 Stage 2 will be implemented as soon as the system stabilises. Also read: Police officers arrested for allegedly soliciting bribe from rape-accused Eskom previously confirmed that load-shedding stage 2 will be implemented from 10:00 on June 9 to 22:00 on June 13, “due to delays in returning generating units”.“Due to continued delays in returning generation units to service at Kusile, Tutuka, Duvha, Kendal and Koeberg power stations, stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented”. Eskom said the constraints in generation units “have been exacerbated by the high winter demand throughout the day over the past few days”. The power utility tried to stave off load-shedding during the day by using emergency reserves, which have now been depleted.“It is, therefore, necessary to implement load-shedding continuously in order to replenish the emergency reserves”.Eskom warned that capacity constraints will “continue for the foreseeable future” and urged South Africans to reduce electricity consumption.
