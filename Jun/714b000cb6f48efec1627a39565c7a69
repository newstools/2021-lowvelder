She visited KaNyamazane Community Healthcare Centre (CHC), Barberton Hospital and M’Afrika CHC on Monday. This followed complaints from the public that there was a shortage of medicine at health facilities. She started with a brief virtual meeting with the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) which also raised the same concerns.  “The department is closely monitoring health facilities hence I am visiting clinics and hospitals to check the situation. We have noted the concerns and I have given an instructions that medicine must ordered with speed from our pharmaceutical depot in Middelburg. By July 2 all health facilities should be having adequate quantities of medicine,” she said. According to a statement by the department, when she arrived at CHC she discovered that it had a limited stock, especially of chronic medicine. She proceeded to Barberton Hospital where the situation was the same . “The premier and I we will on Friday visit the depot to check if all required medicines have been dispatched to all health facilities. We have instructed our staff with immediate effect to work day and night to ensure that we provide all medicine. “The medical depot has also been instructed to ensure that all ordered medicine be dispatched to all health facilities. I can confirm that medicine is already being delivered in other health facilities as instructed,” she said.
