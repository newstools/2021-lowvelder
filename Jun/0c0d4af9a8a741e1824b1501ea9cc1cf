Magda Marneweck passed away on Saturday following a battle with Covid-19. A video showing how her colleagues ushered her body out of the hospital has been shared on social media. In this video, in what appears to be an emotional moment, Mediclinic Nelspruit employees can be seen lowering their heads in respect for their fallen colleague. Vic said due to the loss and pain the family are currently facing, he fails to find the right words to describe just how much his sister meant to them. “Everything is still too raw,” he said.  “Magda is a community member that spent almost all her life in Mbombela. She started her nursing career at Rob Ferreira Hospital about 36 years ago. She moved to Mediclinic Nelspruit when it opened and in the ’90s she went to Saudi Arabia for work. She returned to Mediclinic Nelspruit. She attended Laerskool Bergland and Hoërskool Bergvlam. She matriculated in 1983,” said Vic. Robyn Baard, spokesperson for Mediclinic Nelspruit, said it is with great sadness they see frontliners pass away.

She was the unit manager of the orthopaedic ward for 10 years and was employed at Mediclinic Nelspruit for 22 years. “She was an avid animal lover; she nurtured them and had a deep love for all those she came into contact with. Having nursed many members of the community, Magda is sure to me missed, especially by all her colleagues and friends at the hospital,” said Baard.
