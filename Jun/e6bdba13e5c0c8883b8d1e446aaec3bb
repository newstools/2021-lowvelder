The estate was named by the three Nel brothers who used to graze their cattle in the area, and after whom Nelspruit was named. They established their family homestead on an exceptional piece of land that boasted a year-long subtropical climate with soothing breezes and spectacular uninterrupted views, and called it The Rest. Their descendants still own homes on what is now The Rest Nature Estate. Having been awarded a five-star grading and voted the best residential development in South Africa 2017/18 in the International Africa and Arabia Property Awards, The Rest is currently starting the final stage of a three-phase development.  Once completed, the estate will consist of just under 1 000 freehold homes and villas with stands ranging in size from 900 to 16 000 square metres. The Carissa and Combretum villages, which are completely sold out, incorporate a total of 380 stands under phase 1. Albizia Village, which has an additional 300 stands ranging from 850 to 2 200 square metres, forms part of phase 2 and has only a few properties left to sell.  Phase 3 consists of the Gordenia and Eugenia villages, which are currently in the construction stage and will include smaller units better suited to single owners or retirees wanting to downsize. The estate is home to large groups of mixed ages and cultures, including working professionals and foreign investors wishing to experience life in the Lowveld.  The safe, convenient and restful lifestyle makes The Rest an attractive option to active retirees who do not require frail care facilities typically found in other retirement estates. Instead, by living here, they get to enjoy greater freedom while still being closer to their family within the estate and just two minutes from the nearby Mediclinic. They are also allowed to bring their pets with them, usually not the case in other wildlife estates.
