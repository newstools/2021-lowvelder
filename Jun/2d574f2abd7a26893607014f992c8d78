BUSHBUCKRIDGE –  Employees alleged the municipality was covering up what had happened in the mayor’s office last Thursday.  “We are actually worried of what is happening in this municipality, because no steps were taken to report the incident to the police and no criminal case was opened. Municipal property was vandalised during broad daylight and during working hours on June 3. We suspect that the management knows something and are trying to hide the truth from the public. Whose money is going to be used to fix those damages?” said the source.

The damages were reportedly the result of a fight between members of the Bushbuckridge Chamber of Commerce and the municipality after heated arguments, allegedly regarding the construction of Mapulaneng Hospital. Clainton Khoza, acting spokesperson for the municipality, said, “There was actually no break-in into the mayor’s office, except the damage caused in the executive entrance during the storming by members of the Bushbuckridge Chamber of Business.”
