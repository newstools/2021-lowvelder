Due to Covid-19, options in terms of fundraising events or any opportunities to raise money are limited. From there the idea of a market filled with different traders from the Lowveld – who would come and exhibit their products and services – came about. The Penryn Christmas Market was for many years a Lowveld legacy, this served as an inspiration for the Penryn Autumn Community Market; a market to revive the seasonal event. Peta de Wet, a professional market organiser, guided the group through the process and booked the traders. The event was held on May 29 at the school. “It was a pleasure to have a professionally organised event, to support the local traders, to come together as a community in a safe outdoor environment and all at the same time to assist the grade 11 fundraising,” said Franklin Darteh, a Penryn maths teacher and grade 11 fundraiser organiser. “I am really looking forward to the next Penryn market.”
