MBOMBELA –  Its general manager, Antonia de Barros, said it was important for young people to get involved. “South Africa’s extraordinary flora is under threat. It needs to be protected now, so that it can be enjoyed by future generations.” That is why BotSoc has made 500 free youth memberships available through it branches for new members, as a concerted drive to include a community of young plant lovers and for them to connect with more seasoned members. “This connection is critical to the social exchange needed to enable transferring knowledge, skills and perspective,” said De Barros. These 43 youths are being recruited from diverse communities and their interest in plants and nature will be key to their success. “This youth drive builds on the foundations we already have in place to upskill young conservationists.” ALSO READ: Unemployment stats destroy what little hope is left Enquiries: Adrianne Neethling, LoveGreen Communications, at adrianne@lovegreen.co.za or on 072 437 2227.
