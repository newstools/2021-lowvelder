 The Lowvelder Hero of the Month, brought to you by West Pack Lifestyle, gives much deserved credit to a local unsung Lowveld Hero. For the month of May, Lowvelders nominated Landi Bezuidenhout, Nelspruit Hospice CEO and nursing services manager, as the #LocalHero. Bezuidenhout is steadfast in her care of hospice patients. Like a true hero, in the darkest and most challenging time of Covid-19, she never once hesitated to go to a patient’s home when they were in need to care or support. Bezuidenhout has been working for Hospice for several years and has been at Nelspruit Hospice for two. She is passionate about palliative care and describes it as a cloak of care that covers these patients. She works non-stop to ensure that Nelspruit Hospice remains open to continue rendering services to the local community during the pandemic.  Do you know of a local hero who deserves more credit?
