The Wild and Free Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre in Hectorspruit was contacted for the rescue, whereafter Anneke van Schoor, a volunteer for the organisation, went out to the Mbombela residence where the duiker was found. Van Schoor had the duiker examined by a vet who determined that it was in good health. She then proceeded to set the animal free on the farm where she resides.  Wild and Free took to Facebook to ask for donations towards covering the medical expenses, and their call was heeded by Umbhaba Eco Lodge in Hazyview.

She made a few calls and let us know that they would be sponsoring the whole bill. “The lodge has also taken 10 of the banded mongooses in my care and they are busy with a slow release onto their property. As they are an eco lodge, they help us a lot with the animals. “Our motto is ‘rescue, rehabilitate and release,’ so all animals we take in are released back into the wild,” said Van Schoor.
