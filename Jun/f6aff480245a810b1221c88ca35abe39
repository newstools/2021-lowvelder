The church turned 10 on January 7 and is celebrating God’s faithfulness by giving back to the community. It will be celebrated under the theme of “Ten years of impact” and under Acts 10:38. The celebration will be held from October 31 to November 6. Mwami said this is because it will be summer and the lockdown regulations would hopefully be different. As a way of celebrating its anniversary, the church is planning on handing out food parcels to the less fortunate. Mwami said Covid-19 hit people extremely hard and a lot of people lost their jobs. “It is not the job of the government to feed disadvantaged people; it is the role of the church. The community members are struggling to make ends meet and we saw it fit to play our role as a local church. When the people come to church we do not only feed them spiritually and then let them go. There are some people out there who cannot afford to buy food at all. Some stay in town and they lost their jobs last year during lockdown,” he said. The Holy Ghost Fire House Church currently assists about 1 000 families. The bishop said everyone is welcome and urged all churches to come together to make a difference. “We want everyone to know that it does not matter what religion they follow, we want everyone who needs assistance to come celebrate with us. The food is for everyone.” ALSO READ: MEC for health says Covid-19 infected 2 942 of department’s employees The event will have various activities. “On the Saturday of our celebration we will go out to the community.
