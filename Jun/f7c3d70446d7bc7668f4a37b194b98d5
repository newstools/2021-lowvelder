As the director of 33 and Me Talent Agency, she works closely with actors, singers, models, dancers and voice-over artists, developing their skills in their separate faculties and assisting them with business opportunities where possible. After years of success, working closely with young hopefuls and educating them in the belief that anything is possible, she now wishes to share the message with a broader audience. In doing so Verlinden has secured her own television show, titled Live Your Dream, set for launch in July this year.  The aim is to inspire young, new and aspiring talent to live out their own unique dream. Verlinden explained, “In short, the programme will be insightful, educational and inspirational. It will share the stories of hopeless dreamers that become victorious doers with the guided help of 33 and Me Talent Agency. Through years of experience, we have created platforms where creatives can launch their career paths both locally and internationally.” Live Your Dream will run hand-in-hand with Be Your Dream on ViaTV Channel 147. The show will host numerous workshops and educational training sessions alongside live screenings of the company’s annual auditions for The International ARTS Talent Showcase (IATS). Every year the IATS gives local entertainers a platform to showcase their talent to top international talent scouts from across the globe, bridging the gap between Africa and the world.
