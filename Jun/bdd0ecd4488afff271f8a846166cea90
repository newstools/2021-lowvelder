Why?! What a question! It is Father’s Day, of course, and Sonpark will be abuzz with cars, classic and modern, bikes and about 70 stalls where you will be able to – if you forgot – find some authentic gifts for Dad; things that you would not necessarily be able to find in commercial shops. No socks and definitely no ties, either! Nope, it must be a surprise for both you and Dad, and disappointed you will not be. Entry is free and please do come hungry. Wynand and Chereé Strydom will be on stage to entertain visitors with Afrikaans and country music while you browse the stalls and max the credit cards. There will be a raffle and one lucky visitor will win a weekend getaway to Marloth Park. All proceeds from the event will be donated to CANSA and Huis Betlehem.
