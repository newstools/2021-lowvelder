The Mpumalanga Department of Education has announced that the provincial vaccination programme for teachers and education staff will be launched on Wednesday. The MEC for education, Bonakele Majuba, together with the MEC for health, Sasekane Manzini, will launch the programme at KaNyamazane Education Development Centre (former Ngwenya College). The event will begin at 09:00. The department intends to use this programme to encourage all teachers and support staff within the education sector to take advantage of this opportunity to vaccinate. This vaccination drive is part of an effort to bring down infection numbers while also avoiding hospitalisation due to adverse effects of the virus. “It is imperative that the teaching and support staff of the department are encouraged to vaccinate for Covid-19. It is also worth noting that having vaccinated does not mean that we no longer have to adhere to the non-pharmaceutical Covid-19 health and safety protocols. We also appeal to all schools to establish Covid-19 committees and to appoint compliance officers in an effort to manage and control matters related to the pandemic,” said Majuba.
