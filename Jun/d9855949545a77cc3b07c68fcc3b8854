“These large food parcels consist of critical necessities that a family would require for a month,” Mahesh Srini, executive committee member of Food for Life Nelspruit, said. According to Srini, the communities continuously conveyed their gratitude toward the 35 team members that handed out the parcels. “They voiced how dependent they were on these parcels, and how the distribution of these parcels was the only manner many of them are able to obtain these necessities,” Srini said. The parcels included basic living essentials such as maize meal, rice, sugar, soap and toothpaste. The distribution takes place once a month due to budget constraints. “We are totally dependent on public donations and we are constantly in need of funding,” Srini said. “We are limited in terms of funding; however, we try to reach as many as possible with what we have.” ALSO READ: Food for Life extends a helping hand To contribute in any manner or donate to the organisation, visit www.fflsa.org or send an email to info@fflsa.org.
