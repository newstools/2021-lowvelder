All entrants will have to register to receive their top secret box of secrets at Land Rover Nelspruit between 09:00 and 15:00. You can participate as part of a team or on your own. Teams can consist of a maximum four people. Remember you will need to share your prize money with the team!  Participants of the hunt will receive their clues pointing to 14 locations across Mbombela at 06:00 the morning of the hunt by scanning a QR code placed in the box of secrets. Once you have your clues your hunt starts. You will need to figure out where the location is by using your clues and the box of secrets which will be used through the entire hunt, so keep it close by.  A mobile device loaded with data, transport and an eager brain to solve the riddles. All terms and conditions will be sent through to participants of the hunt by the organisers.
