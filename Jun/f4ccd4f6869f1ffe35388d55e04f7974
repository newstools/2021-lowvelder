The DA in Mpumalanga is concerned that job losses in the province are becoming a bigger threat to families than Covid-19 itself and the subsequent lockdown. MPL Bosman Grobler, DA spokesperson on finance and economic development, said, ”It is revealed that the province lost 15 000 jobs quarter-to-quarter and 113 000 jobs year-on-year between March 2020 to March 2021”. “The Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS) which was released this month shows the devastation of the economy caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the related extended lockdown. “In addition to the above, the expanded unemployment rate for the province grew by 3,7 per cent to being 47,6 per cent from 41,1 per cent in 2018. It is also shocking that the youth unemployment for the province increased to 63 per cent,” he said. “It is serious and action needs to be taken very soon. The DA challenges the provincial government to work with all stakeholders and political parties to find ways of growing the economy and create much needed employment as communities are struggling because of this pandemic. We also cannot talk of an economic reconstruction and recovery plan of creating jobs if it is grounded on unfinished and stalled projects which are all over the province.
