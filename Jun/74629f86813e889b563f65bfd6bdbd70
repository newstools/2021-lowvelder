Entries for the popular Championship Boerewors competition, presented annually by Shoprite and Checkers in their search for SA’s number-one boerewors, are now open and anyone who believes that they have the winning recipe is invited to enter by Friday June 18. Finding the country’s best boerewors is no small feat, which is why judging of the competition is entrusted to the culinary experts at the South African Chefs Association (SACA). All entries will go through a validation process to ensure that recipes adhere to the guidelines for making traditional boerewors and once validated, the experienced judges will commence to select the 30 best recipe submissions. They’ll then take on the even harder task of narrowing it down to the top-10 boerewors recipes, where they will be looking for the most authentic, robust and flavourful entries. Although the winning recipe always remains a closely guarded secret, Delano Jasper, the 19-year-old winner of last year’s competition, says the key to good boerewors is really good quality meat and spices, as well as combining the right mix of ingredients.
