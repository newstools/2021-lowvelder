There is a deep sense of shock and loss, especially for those colleagues who have worked alongside her for so many years. “Her memorial will serve as recognition of her contribution to Penryn and loyalty to many generations of children who have passed through her hands. “May she rest in peace and rise in glory.” Jermyn is survived by her husband, Pat, and her two children, Ryno and Jamie.
