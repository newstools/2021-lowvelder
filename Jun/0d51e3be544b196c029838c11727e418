The SAPS will announce the findings of their internal investigation next week into the incident that occurred at White River Police Station more than two months ago. On March 28, Barend Byliefeldt and his fiancée, Delia Human, were followed to the police station by a group of men in three cars after an altercation occurred on the road to the town. Byliefeldt was then assaulted by the men from the other cars in the police station, while police officers stood idly by. The altercation was caught on video which quickly went viral on social media. ALSO READ: Residents denied entry to White River licensing department AfriForum took on the case of Byliefeldt and Human against the company involved in the incident, MAMRA Security Solutions and VIP Protection. Its branded car was involved in the incident. MAMRA is not registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority. Marnus Kamfer, legal and risk advisor of community safety for AfriForum, who is representing the couple, said they are waiting for the results of the police’s investigation to be made public at the hearing, which will take place on June 10, before they move forward. “The findings will determine where our case will go,” said Kamfer.
