“The NSPCA wishes to remind the public that all unwanted and stray animals may be surrendered to any of the SPCA branches across the country, at no charge, if need be,” the statement read. The organisation implored all members of the public who are struggling to take care of their pets to surrender the animals to their local SPCA or animal welfare shelter rather than to let the animal suffer.

This means you may have to acknowledge you no longer have the means to provide the necessary veterinary treatment or food and shelter for the animal, and surrender the animal to the SPCA. “This does not mean that you do not love or care for your pet, it simply means you love or care for them enough to ensure that their needs are met.” The release continued by stating that being a responsible owner means that you will not sell your pet online or pass it on to friends or family, or give the animal away to a “good home” when you can no longer afford to keep it. “There is no way to guarantee your beloved pet will be treated with kindness and compassion if the above route is taken.

The SPCA is willing to accept all unwanted animals of any size and species. “We wish to assure the public that they should not be afraid to surrender pets for whatever reason. The SPCA does not charge for animals to be surrendered, however, donations are welcome.” For assistance, contact your local SPCA, the details for which can be found on www.nspca.co.za under the “locate” icon.
