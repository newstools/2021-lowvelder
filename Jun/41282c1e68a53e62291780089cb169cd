This is according to Juan Pieterse, head of rugby at the school. “If the players look good and feel good, they play well,” Pieterse said. “The players wear their kit with pride.” According to Martin Barnard, marketing manager of Nashua Lowveld, they regard the sponsorship as an act of investing in the future generation. “It is a privilege for us to give back to the younger generation and support them to achieve their best in everything they do,” Barnard said. “As a company we see it as part of our social responsibility to invest back into the schools that support us.” He stated that they do not regard the sponsorship as a business transaction. “It is about improving the lives of young people who will be the future generation,” he said. “Nashua has always been one of our biggest supporters,” said Natacha Bouwer, marketing officer of Lowveld High. “We are extremely grateful for our partnership.” ALSO READ: Eskort gives back by sponsoring hockey team’s kit
