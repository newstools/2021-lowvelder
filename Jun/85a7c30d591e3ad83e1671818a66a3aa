“I wanted them to come see the Lowveld,” said Marina Coetzee, who organised the event. “There are so few things that happen here in our stunning province.” Avon Middleton, journalist at TopGear, discovered if it was possible to get from Barberton to Malelane without using any public roads. Middleton drove over the Makhonjwa Mountains in a Toyota Hilux. One needs special permission to drive this route, which consists of hairpin turns, high cliffs and rocky terrain. He was helped by Wynand Engelbrecht, the owner of the local off-road adventure company, Dusty Tracks, who is familiar with the terrain. Lowvelders will know that a trip from Barberton to Malelane usually take 45 minutes. However, Middleton’s journey lasted around six hours.  When Engelbrecht and Middleton reached the end of the Makhonjwa Mountain descent, they completed the rest of the journey with Werner and Johan Horn. The brothers are the reigning Class T champions in the South African Cross Country Championships. Middleton had the chance to drive their self-built bakkie, which he describes as “100% race car”.

He didn’t realise what a beast the vehicle was,” said Coetzee. “You have to remember that Avon is someone who has driven every type of car you can think of. “It was an unbelievable experience to have that calibre of people here in the Lowveld. We could show them what we have to offer and how beautiful our area is.” You can watch the whole journey on TopGear South Africa’s Youtube channel.
