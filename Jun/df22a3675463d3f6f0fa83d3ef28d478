The two suspects were caught in the act by the infuriated group at the Absa ATMs in the Longtom SUPERSPAR complex on Monday May 31.
The Lydenburg SAPS was called after the community justice took place and security guards were forced to intervene as the situation escalated. The public alleged that the suspects were tampering with the ATMs outside the bank. Footage and photos of the two suspects went viral on social media. Both of the suspects were bloodied and the soles of one’s shoes were ripped off. “People should not trust strangers to assist them to draw money. They must go into the bank and request assistance from an official employee. The old rules apply that they must make sure no one is seeing their pin code,” said Motsileng. A third suspect ran away and the police would appreciate information on his possible whereabouts; call Motsileng or the station on 013 235 2111. The two suspects appeared in the Lydenburg Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday June 1 and the case was postponed for further investigation.
