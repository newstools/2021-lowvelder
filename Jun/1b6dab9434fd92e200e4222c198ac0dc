Les Hooper said he had been enjoying a cigarette out in his garden just before 07:00 last Wednesday went he heard a car revving. “I had just finished my cigarette and got up from where I was sitting when I heard this car revving nearby. The next minute, I heard this big crash and all of a sudden, this car came crashing through my garden wall. I just could not believe it. “The car stopped around three metres from me, and if I had still been sitting my legs would have been crushed by the rubble and the debris,” said Hooper.

He told me he would make a plan to fix my wall, but I have not heard from him since the crash.” ALSO READ: Gallery: Mbombela residents show their hail photos Hooper has an accident report of which he gave a copy to Lowvelder and said since he had not heard from the driving school, he started trying to patch up the wall himself. “I don’t know if I will hear from him and if he will help fix the wall. I think that all driving schools should be insured.” Attempts to contact the driving school were unsuccessful at the time of going to press.
