Stephanie Amos, who was attacked in her residence in the early hours of Thursday March 4, was released from hospital on Monday. Her husband, Dave (76), was killed during the attack. Stephanie was stabbed multiple times in her legs.
The police have yet to give feedback on the matter. The couple were attacked in their house in Geelhout Street by three men who made off with a TV and a laptop.
They had moved to Mbombela from Gqeberha in January. They were renting the Geelhout Street house temporarily until they could move to their house in Marloth Park. The Amoses were found by their landlord who had to climb through a window of which the burglar bars had been removed by the attackers. “It was their dream to live in Marloth Park,” said their landlord. “Our house is probably six steps away from theirs and on the same property.” The landlords had heard a woman scream and a loud noise, but were not sure from where. They only went next door after Stephanie had called them. “All she could say was, ‘We’ve been attacked! I think Dave is dead.’ I don’t think I’ll ever come to terms with what we had to see: blood everywhere, Stephanie lying on the floor bleeding really badly. “We ran to the room where Dave was lying in the corner. You could immediately see he was dead. I don’t think our lives will ever be normal again. How do you work through something like that? How do you forget what you’ve seen?” The landlords phoned their son who lives abroad, who then phoned the necessary authorities.
