In February this year, three accused who had been arrested in August 2018, were sentenced after a long trial in the Mhala Regional Court. They were all found guilty of crimes related to rhino poaching, including possession of two sets of rhino horns, possession of a high-calibre hunting rifle and ammunition, trespassing in a national park with the intention of committing crime and the illegal hunting of an endangered animal. Peter Mathebula was sentenced to effectively 23 years behind bars, while his two co-accused, Mustard Mathebula and Artur Valoyi, were sentenced to effectively four years in jail. The three were arrested by SANParks rangers in the Houtboschrand Section of the Kruger National Park (KNP) after reacting to shots that had been fired. On March 15, the court concluded yet another rhino poaching case dating back to 2016. The two accused, Bennet Martin Lubisi and Bennet Johannes Bendane, were sentenced to effectively eight years behind bars for poaching-related charges. They were found guilty of trespassing in a national park, in possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition with the intention to commit a crime. They were arrested before they could kill any animals.

Successes of this nature show the importance of cooperation between the various state agencies to help combat the assault on the rhino population in the KNP. “We hope that the many outstanding cases can be concluded as soon as possible so as to act as a clear deterrent to those involved,” concluded Coleman. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that cases will resume at the Skukuza Regional Court as of April 1, 2021.
