The day kicked off with an inspirational session by internationally known motivational speaker, Jannie Putter. Putter focused the session on teamwork and the crucial personal responsibility needed to make a success of an organisation made up solely of volunteers. The newly elected chairperson, Pieter de Bruyn, made use of this day to share his vision for the upcoming year.

These members shared the progress made throughout the challenging pandemic last year and what they hoped to achieve in 2021/22. Once the meeting reached its end, the members took to the bush around Berg-en-Dal to clear some of the immediate surroundings of underbrush so as to create a firebreak between the camp and the veld.   The organisation does not only limit itself to work inside the KNP, but also reaches out to the community when possible. The SANParks Honorary Rangers is always looking for new volunteers who love giving their time to nature. Should you wish to join the organisation, you may contact De Bruyn on 082-558-4369 or visit the SANParks Honorary Rangersâ€™ website.
