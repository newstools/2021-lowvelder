The Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs (Dardlea) recently introduced state vets undergoing compulsory community service (CCS) in the Ehlanzeni District. The veterinary services chief directorate officially introduced these veterinarians who will be stationed in state vet offices. According to a document shared by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on March 2015 (www.savc. org.za) the programme aims to provide accessible and affordable veterinary services to under-resourced areas. CCS shall be performed by every person registering for the first time as a veterinarian in terms of the Veterinary and Para-Veterinary Professions Amendment Act 2012. It includes persons who obtained their qualifications outside the Republic of South Africa, unless exempted. According to Dardlea spokesperson Zanele Shabangu, these vets are part of the 2021 CCS programme.
