Eight to ten armed suspects are still at large in the area after having robbed the Boxer Superstore on Friday evening. The men are said to be armed with at least one semi-automatic weapon and a number of smaller handguns, and were last seen travelling in the direction of Masoyi. According to Albert Gryvenstein of Bossies Community Justice (BCJ), the armed men stormed the Boxer Superstore around 17:00 on Friday. “It is believed that a few shots were fired as the men entered the store, presumably to cause a panic. When the SAPS arrived, there was a brief exchange of bullets, but no one was injured.” Gryvenstein added that the suspects had made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. “We suspect they might also have taken cell phones, but we are not yet sure.” ALSO READ: Outstanding security work leads to arrest of man with rifle Gryvenstein believes this group of suspects might be responsible for other incidents of armed robbery in the Hazyview area.
