Lowveld Walkers are back on the road on Saturdays. According to Joseph Mashaba, the founder of Lowveld Walkers, the group is better and stronger.  The first walk of the year was on March 13 from Kamagugu to Karino. On March 22, the group had its first-ever competitive walk from the Sasol outside White River out on the road to Sabie. Tumelo Sedibe won this event and received a trophy and R500. Mashaba said the group still adheres to lockdown regulations to curb the spread of Covid-19.  “We are back. Due to Covid-19 regulations, we have had to scrap our traditions of holding hands in a circle and sharing water bottles.” ALSO READ: More than ten years later and still no school for the deaf and blind in Mpumalanga Mashaba thanked Build it Matsulu, The Grove SPAR and Buscor for sponsoring their walk by supplying water and fruit.
