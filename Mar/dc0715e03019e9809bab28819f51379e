While family and friends mourn the loss of Dave Amos (75), following the brutal attack on him and his wife, Stephané (67), it appears the robbers had fled with only a laptop and TV. The couple were attacked by three men at around 04:00 on Thursday in their Geelhout Street home leaving Stephané with multiple stab wounds to her legs and in a serious condition.

Bossies Community Justice operations manager, Albert Gryvenstein said when they had arrived at the house, it looked like the suspects had entered the property by forcing open a window and cutting through the burglar bars. “It appears the suspects stole a laptop and a TV. I am unsure if anything else was stolen however, the robbers did not take his (Dave) wallet or cell phone,” said Gryvenstein. The Amoses’ landlord, who asked not to be named, said family of the Amoses were on their way to Mbombela. “We hope to see Stephané later today in hospital, if they allow us, although we are at a loss for words,” said the landlord. “We are struggling, to be truthful; this is a very difficult thing to try and make sense of. “The loss of Dave is heartbreakingly sad. We just pray that Stephané will pull through,” he said. The police have not yet responded to media queries regarding any arrests or what had been stolen during the attack.
