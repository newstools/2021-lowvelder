The two met in Johannesburg when they were teenagers, and were neighbours. “We met when we were about 18 or 19, but we only got married when I was about 28,” said Stewart. “So it was an extended courtship, or whatever you call it.” When asked why their marriage has worked for as long as it has, Stewart said, “Ask the wife.” This made Anneliese laugh. “When I told my mother I was getting married, she said I would get bored. We never had time to get bored. We’ve lived a very exiting life together,” she said.

They moved to Mbombela to be closer to their one daughter who resides in Steiltes. “Our daughter who lives in Sydney sends us pictures of her children every day,” said Anneliese. “You know, when I was young you would send a postcard which would take two weeks to get to the person. Now everything is so instantaneous. “Its been so rewarding to watch our children grow up and see what they have done with their lives.”
