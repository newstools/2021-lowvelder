The festival is due to start at 09:00 and will end at 15:00, with activities and attractions for all to enjoy. PCA secretary, Surika van der Merwe, said the festival is being organised to benefit the organisation to assist children in distress. “A large number of artists, such as our own local Liz McQueen, have made available a huge variety of original paintings from both local and international artists and all will be priced at R100 a painting,” said Van der Merwe. “Furthermore, lucky persons can win vouchers from Tea Thyme should the painting they purchase have a secret sticker on it.” ALSO READ: Opposition parties respond to traffic cop trainee debacle Van der Merwe added there will be a modelling show at the festival, run by Ruby Models of White River. “Due to Covid regulations and the threat of spreading the virus, all models will be modelling their own designer gowns and not from clothing shops. “This modelling show will be judged by four judges, including one of the Pumas players.” Van der Merwe said there will also be a marshmallow Easter egg-eating competition. She added that local up-and-coming band, Vivid Paradox, would be the musical entertainment for the duration of the festival. “It promises to be an action-filled day with something for everyone and our children are the direct beneficiaries of the Fall Festival. Everyone is invited to share in the fun and excitement,” said Van der Merwe. ALSO READ: Municipality commits to improvements in Komati
