This comes as some of its generation units returned to service, helping to restore generating capacity to meet customer demand. Eskom released a statement today, that since Thursday morning, Eskom teams have successfully returned a generation unit each at the Duvha, Medupi, Kendal, Kriel and Kusile power stations. “A further unit each is expected to return to service today at the Camden and Majuba power stations,” said Eskom in the statement.

We currently have 7 183MW on planned maintenance, while another 10 464MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays.” Eskom said the improved generation availability, together with the lower long weekend demand, has enabled it to cancel load-shedding at this point.
