A few lucky locals will be able to see baby owls on the ground during owl hatching season, March to April.However, wildlife experts urge the public not to pick up owl chicks immediately after spotting them. For the next two months they will be learning to fly and their parents might still be keeping an eye on them from a close distance.

If not, it should be picked up, kept warm and taken to the nearest veterinary hospital or rehabilitation centre. “Misinformed people might want to try to feed the barn owlet, but this will be a grave mistake. They have to eat fresh white meat, cut up and force-fed into the gizzard. We urge the public to leave the care-taking to the professionals. It is important to first put the barn owl back into its nest.”
