The Lowveld is a nuts paradise and nowhere will you find a more appropriate place to buy nut-based products to your heart’s content, than at Ambassador Foods’ Factory Shop in White River. Walking through the aisles, you see raw, roasted, salted and flavoured nuts, nut butters, snack mixes and even chocolate-coated nuts. “We offer an extensive product range,” said Raymond Ströh. “ It is not just about nuts. Our premium range offers GMO, lactose- and gluten-free products. The range includes delicious teas and coffee and healthy snacks and granolas, beautifully packed in recyclable packaging. Our breakfast range is perfect for those who are constantly on the run, or mums who prefer simple and quick, but healthy, breakfast options.”  For a snack attack, I bet you a granola bar you won’t be able to withstand temptation when you smell the vanilla fudge – not to mention the mud cake! Hmmm! This will just melt away all your resistance. If nuts are not your favourite, you will also find a large offering of condiments, rusks, spices, herbs and pastas. With gorgeous gift sets and speciality sauces for the weekend braai, there is more than enough with which to fill your basket.
