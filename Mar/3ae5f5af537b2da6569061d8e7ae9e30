“We appreciate the decision of this government to put party differences aside and support the DA’s motion in order to improve the services which residents in White River receive,” said Jane Sithole, the DA Mpumalanga Provincial leader. The vote comes after the Mpumalanga legislature convened to discuss the State of the Province, which took place last week Friday. Bosman Grobler, a DA Member of the Provincial Legislature (MPL), said that the DA was pleased with the ANC’s decision. “We are obviously delighted about the prospect that the backlog may be eradicated.” The DA has made it their goal to improve service delivery within a “reasonable time”.

It isn’t fair on someone who spent 3 hours or more waiting in a queue.” The party also explained that these queues were not safe as it was the optimal space to spread the Corona-virus. “We will continue to monitor the implementation thereof,” said Grobler.
