The limitation of funds is apparent,” Engelbrecht added. “Because of this, KCB requests proper budgeting to ensure that the required items are not only planned, but will also be bought. The chamber asked for an operational plan, with indications of when certain items will be completed. It covers roads, electricity and water.” ALSO SEE: GALLERY: A day in the wild with Marc Cronje However, KCB did notice immediate action from NLM after the meeting.

Engelbrecht said NLM’s director of infrastructure, Jonathan Ntasbo, has been liaising with the chamber directly. “The matters requiring attention are now discussed on management level, which is the level the community and chamber desired.” ALSO READ: Premier proposes Mountain View recommended site for Mbombela’s new dam
