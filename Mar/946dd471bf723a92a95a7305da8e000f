As a way to launch its 2021 Easter campaign, the Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) recently hosted the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences, or AARTO Friday. They stationed themselves at Samora Machel Drive for the day. Dr Kaine Monyepao, the deputy registrary for strategy development, told Lowvelder that RTIA had adopted the AARTO Friday Campaign to take its services closer to road users.  Monyepao said motorists were assisted to check their AARTO infringement status. “We are in Mbombela primarily to raise awareness about the importance of being safe during the Easter holidays. We are also here to educate the public about AARTO legislation. It will be implemented throughout South Africa as from July 1. “The most important thing about the legislation is the points demerit system. If you are caught on the wrong side of the law, you are going to be fined; you also face prospects of losing your licence. When you have accumulated more than 13 points, your licence will be suspended. If it gets suspended for the third time, we will cancel it and you will have to redo it. This will be from learner licences. We will provide rehabilitation for the motorists that get their licences cancelled,” he said.  The agency launched the AARTO Service Outlet in Mbombela on December 18, which started operating on January 18. It was the first launched and fully operational outside Gauteng.
