After many postponements as a result of Covid-19, it is happening. Elana Burger Dance School will finally present its highly anticipated production, Aladdin, on March 23 and from March 25 to 27. “We started this journey more than a year ago. Some of the costumes might need to be adjusted, the cast has changed a bit, but everyone is excited to see this production come to life,” said the owner of the dance school, Elana Burger. “With every safety measure in place, Aladdin will be performed at Hoërskool Rob Ferreira during the last week of March. Limited seats are available due to Covid restrictions. Everything has happened online for the past year – classes, competitions and even exams.

Burger, who was later joined by her daughter, Nandi, has been teaching dancers in this area for the past 15 years. “We have annual exams, we participate in national and international competitions as well as the eisteddfod. Five of our dancers received Mpumalanga and SA colours for dancing last year,” Elana said. “Dancing has many advantages. It helps muscle development, fitness and flexibility. It assists in the development of discipline, coordination and teamwork. “Dancing is fun and in an uncertain time, it has offered consistency to many of our students, especially during the lockdown period,” she concluded. Limited tickets for the production are available on 073-888-5376
