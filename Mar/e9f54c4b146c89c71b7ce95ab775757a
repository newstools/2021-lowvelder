Kwena dam is the main source of water supply in the Crocodile catchment which runs through Dullstroom toÂ  Komatipoort.  The dam almost ran out of the precious resource during the 2015-2016 droughts. The water we have today is not guaranteed for tomorrow. It needs you and I to take care of our water resources. Take action now, tomorrow might be too late!
