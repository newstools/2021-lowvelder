The court has not operated for over a year due to a legal battle waged by the Mpumalanga Regional Court’s president, Naomi Annette Engelbrecht, to have the Skukuza Regional Court closed and all its cases transferred to the Mhala Regional Court. Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court dismissed her application for leave to appeal a High Court decision allowing the Skukuza Regional Court to continue operating inside the Kruger National Park (KNP).

Mketeni also took time to wish all South Africans a blessed Easter weekend, and reminded all day visitors that gate quotas at national parks such as the KNP would be in place from Friday to Monday, April 2 to 5. “We urge those who will be visiting their national parks to drive safely while observing Covid-19 protocols for their own safety and of the people around them. “Let us respect the privacy of others on holiday, observe speed limits in our national parks and come back inspired by all the beautiful sightings and the tranquil scenery our parks are popular for,” concluded Mketeni. Day visitors are advised to book online so as to avoid disappointment at the gates.
