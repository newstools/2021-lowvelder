What are the benefits of prepaid submeters?Prepaid submeters ensure that tenants prepay for their utilities (electricity/water) before usage, eliminating tenant and owner arrears for electricity/water consumed.There is no need for frequent manual meter readings and there is a significant reduction in the administration associated with utility accounts for landlords and body corporates. How it worksOur meters are installed as a secondary meter inside the dwelling, typically at the mains distribution board or in the external electricity kiosks. The prepaid meter does not interfere with or impair the operation of the primary (municipal) meter. The meter has a keypad and special encryption security. When a resident purchases prepaid electricity, we generate a numeric token based on a given tariff rate. This token is entered into the meter and credits it, which in turn permits the resident to use a predetermined amount of electricity. When the meter credit runs low it alarms the tenant to purchase more tokens. The tenant must replenish his meter by prepaying for tokens, failing which the meter will not provide more electricity.
