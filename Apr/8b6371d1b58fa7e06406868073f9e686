The head of the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Busisiwe Nkuna, has accepted her suspension for not having removed 125 candidates from the Mpumalanga Traffic College in Bushbuckridge in March, as she was instructed to do. Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane sent Nkuna the letter of suspension on March 25. The department is set to investigate the appointment of the 125 trainee traffic officer, which the premier labelled a “flawed” process.
