Zuma will go into retirement after having served as police commissioner since 2016. He is only the second commissioner in the province to complete his term in this position. Zuma said he is looking forward to the next chapter of his life. Officials of various law enforcement agencies, such as the Department of Correctional Services, SANDF and the Department of Justice, gave speeches honouring Zuma’s career. The spokesperson for the provincial SAPS, Brig Leonard Hlathi, led the evening’s programme. The keynote speaker was Maj Gen PT Phahla: “Mpumalanga is a very unique province. The commissioner managed to lead us and understood its dynamics. It is not easy to police this province. You have to deal with protests, politics and labour issues. “The commissioner would try to engage with people and would try to address these issues. We thank you for your leadership, for so selflessly giving yourself to the SAPS and for serving our country.” Col MS Gopane of the SANDF said that Zuma’s aim was always to make the province safe. “The bar you set is very high.” Adv Paul Mthimunye of the Department of Justice said Zuma had been central to fighting crime in the province. “He led by example; he was always where things were happening. Our province was indeed in good hands and was one of the most envied provinces due to the commissioner’s dedication.” Kevin Pillay, the provincial chairperson for the Community Police Forum Board, lauded the commissioner for taking matters into his own hands when the situation called for it. “He never negated us to a ceremonial structure. He understood that in certain situations one had to adapt in order to affect policy.”
