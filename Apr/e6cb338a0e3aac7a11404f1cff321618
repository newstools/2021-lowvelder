“The community has been incredibly supportive since Jordan’s diagnosis in 2013,” said Teresa Coertzen, Jordan’s mother. “There were times where we had little to no options left in terms of financial aid or living costs, and every single time the community has carried us through it.” According to Coertzen they are currently experiencing similar hardships. Jordan – who also suffers from epilepsy, hydrocephalus and feeding difficulties – only has 10 to 15 per cent of working brain function. He has had seven operations to date and is fed through a Mic-Key feeding tube implanted through his stomach. Coertzen stopped working in 2013 to take care of Jordan full-time. “He has to be fed up to eight times a day and cannot be out of my sight even for a second as he often chokes on his own spit,” she said. “He is getting too heavy for me to lift, so I struggle to bathe him and I have to do everything myself – I don’t have any assistance.”  ALSO READ: Jordan and his mom, Teresa, share their story Coertzen is currently in search of a caregiver to assist in Jordan’s care. “We are also in urgent need of any form of financial aid for basic living expenses such as water, electricity and ultimately to save up for a car to take Jordan to his doctor’s appointments,” she said. “We are struggling,” she said. “However, the people of Nelspruit’s hearts have always been open to us and we are truly thankful for every bit of support.” ALSO READ: A place to call Jordan’s Home Donations can be paid into Jordan’s bank account and any form of assistance can be arranged with Teresa directly, on 060-719-1947.
