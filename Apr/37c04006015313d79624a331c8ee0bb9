Although any donations are welcome, the organisation listed a few things on Facebook of which they are desperately in need. Winter is upon us, and donations of any warm blankets, new or old, to help keep the cats and dogs warm, are needed. It will be the first winter for some of these animals and they are in need of warms beds during the cold nights. Along with the blankets, the animals need to be fed, and cat and dog food may be delivered to the SPCA or ordered on Takealot with instructions to deliver straight to the kennels. Lastly, the staff uniforms are a bit “worse for wear”, and companies are asked support them by sponsoring uniforms to continue doing their work. Any donations may be made directly to SPCA Nelspruit, or EFTed to: Nelspruit SPCA, Absa cheque, 1081510080. ALSO READ: SPAR Lowveld helps fill young tummies donating porridge to PCA
