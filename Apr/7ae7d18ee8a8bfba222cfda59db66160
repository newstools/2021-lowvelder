The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency’s (MTPA) staff are currently on strike through the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu). The strike started this morning. The MTPA’s spokesperson, Kholofelo Nkambule, said this has affected their nature reserves as well, which are closed for the public at this stage. “The management is currently in discussion with Nehawu to determine the issues of concern that, among others, relate to the filling of senior management positions in the new organigram as well as salary disparities.

Once both management and Nehawu have finalised their discussions and agree on a way forward, the operations at all our offices, including the nature reserves, will resume.” The MTPA continues to monitor the situation and will provide an update in due course. Waterfalls managed by South African Forestry Company Ltd (Safcol) are unaffected. This is a developing story.
